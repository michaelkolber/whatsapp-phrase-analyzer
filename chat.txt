10/31/17, 8:38 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Do you remember that time u said you'll make it up to me?‚ò∫
10/31/17, 9:04 PM - Michael Kolber: Haha yes, how can I help
10/31/17, 9:08 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So I'm trying to figure out if I should take computer science or not, everyone I talked to is obsessed with it, what do u think about it?
10/31/17, 9:18 PM - Michael Kolber: I think it depends if it's something you enjoy. Are you someone who enjoys problem-solving and troubleshooting? Would you be okay sitting at a desk for your job? Do you think you'll enjoy expressing yourself in code more than in another medium?
10/31/17, 9:21 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha u had me at sitting at a desk
10/31/17, 9:22 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah it's kind of necessary for the job
10/31/17, 9:22 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats my problem with everything tho I dont want a regular sitting at desk 9 to 5 job
10/31/17, 9:22 PM - Michael Kolber: There's IT but that's not really computer science, more of it's own thing
10/31/17, 9:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah i know, I've done coding before didn't really enjoy it so considering giving it another chance
10/31/17, 9:23 PM - Michael Kolber: Well you don't need class for that. Just try something like CodeCademy
10/31/17, 9:25 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Right so by trying coding I meant I took a class on it
10/31/17, 9:25 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So I kind of get what programming is like
10/31/17, 9:29 PM - Michael Kolber: Okay, but if you'll give it another go why not try online? That way you don't have to commit to a class
10/31/17, 9:30 PM - Michael Kolber: Alternatively, you can take CS111 as an extra class this semester. If you're anyway doing full time, an extra class won't cost you anything. You can start it and if you don't like it you can drop it by the drop date
10/31/17, 9:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah that's what I was thinking
10/31/17, 9:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But its hard to fit it in my schedule since theres so much too it
10/31/17, 9:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Trying it online is a good idea
10/31/17, 9:35 PM - Michael Kolber: I think you anyway have to graduate in more than 3.5 years even if you have sem credits because of Gen Ed requirements, so why not do some Gen Ed courses this semester while you still figure out whether you enjoy CS. If so you can always take it next year, and if not then you got in your Gen Ed courses anyway
10/31/17, 9:38 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I couldnt go to sem so I just have credits from APs and other college classes anyway but yeah Im trying to get through with the Gen Eds just cant figure out which classes to take
10/31/17, 9:38 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm a very indecisive person if u haven't noticed yet haha
10/31/17, 9:39 PM - Michael Kolber: Alright so in that case take gen eds and/or interesting courses to fulfill your electives
10/31/17, 9:39 PM - Michael Kolber: Dw I'm indecisive too
10/31/17, 9:39 PM - Michael Kolber: That's why I'm taking 2 cs courses this semester and 3 next semester and still haven't declared a major üòÅ
10/31/17, 9:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha wow why don't u just declare the major isnt easy to undeclare later?
10/31/17, 9:42 PM - Michael Kolber: haha idk
10/31/17, 9:42 PM - Michael Kolber: I don't think it really matters
10/31/17, 9:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Problem with that is how am I going to discover a major if I dont try out different classes
10/31/17, 9:44 PM - Michael Kolber: Well yeah but like you can't try psychology online, for example, but you can coding. So you may as well try coding online and use the available spot for psychology or whatever you think might interest oyu
10/31/17, 9:44 PM - Michael Kolber: you
10/31/17, 9:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I've taken 2 psychology classes in highschool haha never again its super depressing but yeah I get that its just an example
10/31/17, 9:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So I might take CS out and replace it with Bio
10/31/17, 9:48 PM - Michael Kolber: ok. Are you a sciences person?
10/31/17, 9:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm a math person sort of sciences
10/31/17, 9:49 PM - Michael Kolber: you could always major in math
10/31/17, 9:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: And then what haha
10/31/17, 9:51 PM - Michael Kolber: You can be an actuary
You can teach
You can do data science
10/31/17, 9:52 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like math gets very intense tho
10/31/17, 9:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So majoring in it will be very complicated
10/31/17, 9:55 PM - Michael Kolber: Doesn't everything though?
10/31/17, 9:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Well yeah
10/31/17, 9:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I don't know
10/31/17, 9:57 PM - Michael Kolber: idk sometimes I feel daunted at the prospect of doing advanced algorithms in CS and then I end up realizing that it's not so hard if you do it slowly. If it's something you know you enjoy give the more advanced stuff a shot
10/31/17, 9:57 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont think I'll enjoy the advanced math haha
10/31/17, 9:58 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Im trying LCD next semester for the major and for Gen Ed so that's helpful
10/31/17, 9:58 PM - Michael Kolber: what's that
10/31/17, 10:00 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Linguistics and Communication Disorders
10/31/17, 10:00 PM - Michael Kolber: oh. it always interests me that it's its own major and apparently a popular one
10/31/17, 10:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah very popular
10/31/17, 10:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Kind of bothers me
10/31/17, 10:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I want to do something different
10/31/17, 10:01 PM - Michael Kolber: haha then cs probably isn't the right choice
10/31/17, 10:02 PM - Michael Kolber: there's nothing wrong with doing the popular thing if you actually enjoy it
10/31/17, 10:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha yeah I think I should just be an astronaut, you don't hear that everyday
10/31/17, 10:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: True but Im not sure what interests me yet
10/31/17, 10:18 PM - Michael Kolber: not a bad idea actually...
10/31/17, 10:19 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Okay perfect I'm calling up NASA for an internship as we speak
10/31/17, 10:20 PM - Michael Kolber: Why don't you try reading some things that you haven't previously? Could be magazines, could be subreddits, could be websites. Tech, medicine, architecture, rocket science, CompLit, sociology, gender studies
10/31/17, 10:20 PM - Michael Kolber: Nice put in a word for me while you're at it
10/31/17, 10:22 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh that's an interesting suggestion, I like to look random things up sometimes
10/31/17, 10:22 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So they're currently full but maybe we can try a different company
10/31/17, 10:22 PM - Michael Kolber: Hey, looking up random things is what I do ALL the time instead of writing the philosophy paper that I should be right now
10/31/17, 10:22 PM - Michael Kolber: SpaceX
10/31/17, 10:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha Im also supposed to be writing philosophy paper!
10/31/17, 10:23 PM - Michael Kolber: no way
10/31/17, 10:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Emphaasis on suppose to.... not actually doing it
10/31/17, 10:23 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm actually on the second essay
10/31/17, 10:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Dialing
10/31/17, 10:23 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm so closeeeeeeeeeeee
10/31/17, 10:24 PM - Michael Kolber: I think Elon Musk is more likely to answer if you just slip into his Tesla through the sunroof
10/31/17, 10:24 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So just finish u can do it. Go! Go! Go!
10/31/17, 10:25 PM - Blah Blah Blah: On my way, not so sure he'll be happy about it though

10/31/17, 10:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha why didnt u use the male emoji ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
10/31/17, 10:31 PM - Michael Kolber: I actually don't see gender so I didn't even realize which emoji I was using
10/31/17, 10:33 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What do u mean u don't see gender?
10/31/17, 10:40 PM - Michael Kolber: Like what even is a gender man
10/31/17, 10:41 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah
10/31/17, 10:42 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm actually arguing with a bunch of LGBT people right now about whether government is inherently oppressive, so this fits in perfectly
10/31/17, 10:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha where'd u find these people?
10/31/17, 10:43 PM - Michael Kolber: The internet is a very large place
10/31/17, 10:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh I see

10/31/17, 10:47 PM - Michael Kolber: TAX THE GAYS
10/31/17, 10:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Great slogan, ordering posters and markers from amazon
10/31/17, 10:48 PM - Michael Kolber: For someone who's so indecisive, you're very impuslive
10/31/17, 10:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha that's literally me
10/31/17, 10:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: üòÇüòÇ
10/31/17, 10:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It's  a serious problem
10/31/17, 10:50 PM - Michael Kolber: maybe instead of a class take a meditation thingy
10/31/17, 10:51 PM - Michael Kolber: you can porbbly get credit
10/31/17, 10:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah I'm sure they have yoga or something
10/31/17, 10:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U are full of ideas today
10/31/17, 10:52 PM - Michael Kolber: üòäüòä
10/31/17, 10:52 PM - Michael Kolber: now if only I could use those ideas towards philosophy
10/31/17, 10:52 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha you're still doing it?

10/31/17, 11:01 PM - Michael Kolber: so tell her "Hell no I'm not letting some immigrant take my hard-earned class section"
10/31/17, 11:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahaha but also I don't want to finish 3 times a week at 4:30
10/31/17, 11:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Not Anna btw Ann the nice quiet one
10/31/17, 11:02 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but you get to be in class with cool people like me which more than makes up for it
10/31/17, 11:03 PM - Michael Kolber: ohhh Ann
10/31/17, 11:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U feel bad now dont u
10/31/17, 11:03 PM - Michael Kolber: yeah don't say that to Ann she'll beat you up

10/31/17, 11:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hmm no I need a better argument
10/31/17, 11:04 PM - Michael Kolber: blame it on capitalism maybe?
10/31/17, 11:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Better but not quite there

10/31/17, 11:44 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha and now you'll remember this for the rest of your life
10/31/17, 11:44 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What time is her class?

10/31/17, 11:48 PM - Michael Kolber: Don't forget:
We will register you for all other courses that allow for registration.  That means that we will not be able to register you into courses such as Business, some FNES, some LCD or EECE which all have comments in the comment area when you look them up in CUNYFirst requiring ‚ÄúDepartmental Permission‚Äù or ‚ÄúMajors Only‚Äù to take the courses. So if you are interested in a program and can declare the major ‚Äì declare the major.
10/31/17, 11:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha i opened this text and just said omg
10/31/17, 11:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah thanks i spoke to her about lcd im in the one thats not for the major

11/1/17, 12:12 AM - Michael Kolber: Ohh I thought you meant you take back about Kayla and Frieda Rivka. Nm
11/1/17, 12:13 AM - Michael Kolber: Anyway I'm off to sleepyland. Goodnight!
11/1/17, 12:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Goodnight and thabks!
11/1/17, 12:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Thanks
11/1/17, 7:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Btw at my meeting with Essie for the schedule, when I told her I'm interested in taking a CS class she pulled out someone else's schedule and based it off of that because of the math class and yesterday I realized it was yours haha
11/1/17, 7:50 PM - Michael Kolber: Glad I could be indirectly of assistance
11/1/17, 7:50 PM - Michael Kolber: What's your final schedule look like?
11/1/17, 7:50 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh so after all that we talked about yesterday I'm taking CSüôà
11/1/17, 7:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Mostly because this semester is a good time for it since I'm taking it with other people I know
11/1/17, 7:52 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Also with my other schedule, I would've finished every single day at 4:30 and I pick up my little brother from school at that time so it doesn't work out
11/1/17, 7:54 PM - Michael Kolber: Ah okay. Best of luck then. Feel free to ask if you ever need help
11/1/17, 7:55 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thanks
11/1/17, 7:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But I definitely considered my options, I printed both schedules and spent all of  philosophy trying to decide so I missed all the notes haha
11/1/17, 7:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thanks for the advice yesturday
11/1/17, 8:11 PM - Michael Kolber: Not worth it :D
11/1/17, 8:11 PM - Michael Kolber: And no problem
11/1/17, 8:12 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ofcourse it is
11/1/17, 8:12 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'll have to deal wit these classes for the next few classes
11/1/17, 8:13 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I still paid attention and I'll just get the notes from someone üëçüèæ
11/1/17, 8:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Well kind of not worth it.... actually dum idea because I let Ann make the decision in the end
11/1/17, 8:14 PM - Michael Kolber: Good luck on the final
11/1/17, 8:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I just cant make decisions
11/1/17, 8:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha I know oh gosh
11/2/17, 5:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: How'd your meeting with Altman go? Did u figure out your thesis transition
11/2/17, 8:58 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, she helped me rethink it
11/2/17, 9:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That's good
11/3/17, 3:57 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeppp. Shabbat shalom!
11/3/17, 4:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I think u need to add 1 more "p"
11/3/17, 4:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Shabbat shalom!

11/3/17, 4:20 PM - Blah Blah Blah: See what a difference it makes
11/3/17, 4:21 PM - Michael Kolber: Ohp yeahp It'sp incrediblep
11/3/17, 4:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Life changing really
11/3/17, 4:24 PM - Michael Kolber: Right? Like who even needs religion
11/3/17, 4:25 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha since u dicovered it I guess u can name the movement
11/3/17, 4:26 PM - Michael Kolber: Pism
11/3/17, 4:27 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Simple and straight to the point üëçüèª
11/8/17, 10:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: You're the one who has to fail so all of us can succeed. Taking one for the team. üòÇ
11/8/17, 10:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Fraida Rivka to Jonathan ^^^
11/8/17, 10:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Sound familiar?
11/8/17, 10:50 PM - Michael Kolber: I vaguely remember but I've honestly been so stressed from school that my memory has been subpar lately
11/8/17, 10:50 PM - Michael Kolber: Like I remember the whole convo we had but not the premise
11/8/17, 10:51 PM - Michael Kolber: Which is so weird
11/8/17, 10:54 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah school has been tough on us lately
11/8/17, 10:54 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I was looking forward to tomorrow then I realized the museum thing is this Friday
11/8/17, 10:55 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Basically Jonathan is our scapegoat
11/8/17, 10:57 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm going Sunday :D/D:
11/8/17, 10:57 PM - Michael Kolber: That's so mean of us. Why would we do that
11/8/17, 11:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It was your plan
11/8/17, 11:04 PM - Michael Kolber: Wow that's not very nice of me
11/8/17, 11:11 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Apparently school is affecting more than just your memory
11/8/17, 11:14 PM - Michael Kolber: Ah, but is it making me less compassionate or more?
11/8/17, 11:18 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'll go with more
11/8/17, 11:26 PM - Michael Kolber: Quite generous of you
11/8/17, 11:28 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh stop‚ò∫ (Go on)
11/8/17, 11:30 PM - Michael Kolber: My contract forbids me

11/8/17, 11:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Does it talk to u?
11/8/17, 11:31 PM - Michael Kolber: Not anymore than the voices in my head
11/8/17, 11:32 PM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
11/8/17, 11:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Michael ur losing it

11/9/17, 12:57 AM - Michael Kolber: Oh no the articles were great. Totally agree, speaking three languages really made it more relatable. It was just writing that was bleh

11/13/17, 5:46 PM - Michael Kolber: I just took a nap for 45 minutes so hopefully that'll help
11/13/17, 5:59 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Great choice
11/13/17, 6:18 PM - Michael Kolber: This introduction is way too long
11/13/17, 6:19 PM - Michael Kolber: It's like when people get up to introduce another speaker but practically give a speech themselves. Like, if they wanted you to speak they would have asked you to speak, not to introduce
11/13/17, 6:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha
11/13/17, 6:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Just starting now slow down
11/13/17, 6:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Kenney wanted some attention
11/13/17, 6:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Well then he should have written a different book. I probably paid 80¬¢ or so more just for that intro
11/13/17, 7:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What a waste, u could've gotten two gum balls with that kind of money
11/13/17, 7:18 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah
11/13/17, 7:18 PM - Michael Kolber: Or even 3 cheap oned
11/13/17, 7:19 PM - Michael Kolber: Haha of all the comparosons
11/13/17, 7:21 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha cuz u can't get much for 80¬¢ anymore
11/13/17, 7:21 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U could save up and get a snickers bar
11/13/17, 7:26 PM - Michael Kolber: I should buy multiple books without the intro. That way I'll save tons of money over time
11/13/17, 7:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: And use it to buy all different kinds of candies!
11/13/17, 7:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ok we need to move on from this haha
11/13/17, 7:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Indeed. I've got an entire half of an outline of an essay so far
11/13/17, 7:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Woo...
11/13/17, 8:00 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That's something
11/13/17, 8:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Woah too much excitement, calm down
11/13/17, 8:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Whats ur arguement?
11/13/17, 8:36 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm trying sorry. It's all this literature. The real reason I didn't join the honors in the humanities program is because I'm scared I won't be able to contain my joy and anticipation
11/13/17, 8:41 PM - Michael Kolber: Basically
He's shown from the beginning that he's physically oriented. Mostly photos. But also the hair thing, complaining about food.
Also always curious. Noses into conversation in beginning of book. Wants to learn magic despite threat of life. 
Also impulsive. Considers killing photis just for her mistake. 
Paralleled by psyche. She is overcome with passion. Has no restraint. 

So when he's faced with religion, he's just motivated by greed and curiosity, compounded by impulsiveness. He holds back from initiation because it's too hard. So overjoyed about being returned his horse that he doesn't need. Just wants the secrets of the religion. Describes in detail how striking he looked, how people crowded in to gaze at him 
And then he also meets Asinius Marcellus, which may signify that he hasn't really left the ass behind yet (no pun intended)

And that's where I'm at
11/13/17, 8:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah I totally get it its hard to contain the excitement. You should work on it don't miss out on such amazing opportunities
11/13/17, 8:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha I love how u started this with basically and then gave me a whole essay
11/13/17, 8:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Sounds really good
11/13/17, 8:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Wanna write mine too? I'll do hw 10 for u
11/13/17, 10:07 PM - Michael Kolber: As tempting as that sounds, I don't think Teikmanks would appreciate getting two of the same essay
11/13/17, 10:08 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Mine argument is the opposite actually
11/13/17, 10:09 PM - Blah Blah Blah: My**
11/13/17, 10:11 PM - Michael Kolber: That she'll have to read less so then she will appreciate getting two of the same?
11/13/17, 10:11 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha no I'm talking about Lucius
11/13/17, 10:12 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Once an ass always an ass
11/13/17, 10:12 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Good point tho u should reconsider
11/13/17, 10:13 PM - Michael Kolber: But that's what I said
11/13/17, 10:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh wait, nevermind I'm saying that he's a privileged initiate in the end
11/13/17, 10:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Idk why I just got confused, I need a break üò¨
11/13/17, 10:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: K I gotta go finish this, goodnight
11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Michael Kolber: ◊ú◊ô◊ú◊î ◊ò◊ï◊ë!

11/14/17, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U can get kinder eggs anywhere so that should help your decision
11/14/17, 10:03 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but it's more fun when you get the illegal ones
11/14/17, 12:00 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Altman was in a really good mood today
11/14/17, 12:00 PM - Blah Blah Blah: She actually let us out on time
11/14/17, 12:28 PM - Michael Kolber: Haha maybe she got sick of my rambling
11/14/17, 12:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha good so keep doing what you're doing
11/14/17, 3:06 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U get Altman to end class early and Teik to give us extra time, what is this sorcery?
11/14/17, 3:15 PM - Michael Kolber: It appears that the key is being a loudmouth
11/14/17, 3:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: You really like to beat yourself up dont u
11/14/17, 3:35 PM - Michael Kolber: Is it really beating yourself up if it's the truth?
11/14/17, 3:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Well... yeah ur just pointing out the flaws
11/14/17, 3:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But this doesn't have to be negative
11/14/17, 5:33 PM - Michael Kolber: But then I'm not beating myself up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/14/17, 5:43 PM - Michael Kolber: Like

11/14/17, 5:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But u are cuz u used the negative connotation
11/14/17, 5:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Y dont u use the male emoji
11/14/17, 5:43 PM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
11/14/17, 5:44 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Its so cute

11/14/17, 5:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Tears just need to be a bit higher
11/14/17, 5:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What about this one? ü§£
11/14/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Conversive then?
11/14/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm secretly a rebel
11/14/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Not any better
11/14/17, 5:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I've also noticed that u have a pink pencil, ur so manly
11/14/17, 5:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So what emoji do u use when u laugh?
11/14/17, 6:04 PM - Michael Kolber: I've actually stopped caring so much about my masculinity over the past year and a half. Either it's a sign of maturity or there's something about myself I need to come to terms with üò≥
11/14/17, 6:04 PM - Michael Kolber: And on Android I don't really use laughing emojis because I just don't like the emojis at all. I should get the iOS emojis but then I have to root my phone
11/14/17, 6:15 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I justed updated my whatsapp and the emojis have a better quality now and Im pretty theyre like the ios ones noe
11/14/17, 6:15 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Now
11/14/17, 6:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh am I the first witness? Weren't u arguing with some LGBT ppl online? Clearly that took a turn
11/14/17, 6:26 PM - Michael Kolber: No updates for me :(
11/14/17, 6:26 PM - Michael Kolber: Actually someone mentioned the pink pencil the other day, I don't remember who. But I was arguing with them over politics and they were being wrong
11/14/17, 6:28 PM - Blah Blah Blah: The pic u sent of ur laughing emoji is the one I have... maybe I just updated 30 years late
11/14/17, 6:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: They were being wrong? Haha it politics, all opinions but whats with the pink pencil? There are so many options at the 99c store
11/14/17, 6:31 PM - Michael Kolber: That's an impressive amount of time for a college kid
11/14/17, 6:31 PM - Michael Kolber: I literally have a rainbow of pencils in my bag. Pink happened to be the color I chose
11/14/17, 6:37 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thank u, I use lots of lotions for a younger complexion I see its working
11/14/17, 6:37 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha thats the problem, u chose pink
11/14/17, 6:37 PM - Michael Kolber: You probably relate really well to Altman then
11/14/17, 6:38 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Totally
11/14/17, 6:38 PM - Michael Kolber: I think some feminists would get angry that you're implying pink is a woman's color
11/14/17, 6:38 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Me her and Essie r going out for supper tonight
11/14/17, 6:39 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I happen to think that a pink shirt and a blue suit looks rlly good on guys
11/14/17, 6:39 PM - Michael Kolber: Oh have fun eating matzah
11/14/17, 6:40 PM - Michael Kolber: I happen to strongly disagree
11/14/17, 6:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Jealous?
11/14/17, 6:42 PM - Michael Kolber: It was her lunch today so no
11/14/17, 6:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Then you've never tried it, also depends of the shade of pink and blue
11/14/17, 6:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Why do u know this haha?
11/14/17, 6:43 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm just not a blue suit guy
11/14/17, 6:43 PM - Michael Kolber: Because she has a window instead of a wall for her office
11/14/17, 6:44 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh so u only wear black suits?
11/14/17, 6:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: She needs an upgrade

11/14/17, 10:51 PM - Michael Kolber: Navy I can see looking good but I personally don't love it on myself
11/14/17, 11:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Guess it also depends on hair color and stuff
11/14/17, 11:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Omg I fell asleep at 10, just woke up
11/14/17, 11:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Didnt get any work done tonight :(
11/15/17, 7:26 AM - Michael Kolber: That's annoying
11/15/17, 7:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Your naps are contagious
11/15/17, 10:39 AM - Michael Kolber: Like the ones during philosophy class or...
11/15/17, 10:43 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No I'm talking about yesturday
11/15/17, 10:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But yeah philosophy was tough today
11/15/17, 10:45 AM - Michael Kolber: Haha I'm kidding
11/15/17, 10:45 AM - Michael Kolber: I have no idea what's flying with Nietzsche
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Im so tired I can't even process jokes
11/15/17, 10:46 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Same. And he said the final will have a question on him yay!

11/15/17, 1:40 PM - Michael Kolber: You know I never really got that one
11/15/17, 1:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Its very unnecessary
11/15/17, 1:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But so are these üë∫üå≥üê≤ü•Ñü§º‚Äç‚ôÄüõµ
11/15/17, 1:46 PM - Michael Kolber: As are both üêé and üê¥

11/15/17, 1:58 PM - Michael Kolber: How will we survive.
11/15/17, 2:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm afraid we have no choice but to stick to emoticons
11/15/17, 6:39 PM - Michael Kolber: ^_^
11/15/17, 6:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like this is u in an emoji
11/15/17, 8:19 PM - Michael Kolber: I don't _feel_ Japanese...
11/15/17, 9:26 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Well it was either that emoji or this one ü¶É
11/15/17, 11:04 PM - Michael Kolber: Um
11/15/17, 11:06 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha just realized I put the wrong emoji, oh well
11/16/17, 12:41 AM - Michael Kolber: Mhmmmm
11/16/17, 12:43 AM - Blah Blah Blah: It was suppose to be thisüë©üèº‚Äçüíª perfect for u right?
11/16/17, 12:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Actually yeah
11/16/17, 12:44 AM - Michael Kolber: It even has the girl part
11/16/17, 12:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wait for the AB do I give in a clean copy or the one she marked?
11/16/17, 12:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That's the main focus
11/16/17, 12:44 AM - Michael Kolber: I think just the one she marked?
11/16/17, 12:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That's so weird
11/16/17, 12:45 AM - Michael Kolber: So then if this is a female turkey it should be fine
11/16/17, 12:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its dangerous tho, we're very close to Thanksgiving
11/16/17, 12:45 AM - Michael Kolber: From her
do not change the annotated bibliography; hand in the graded one that you got back. The works cited list at the end of the essay should be just that: works cited, no annotations.
11/16/17, 12:46 AM - Michael Kolber: I'll take my chances üçó
11/16/17, 12:46 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ok don't say i didn't warn you
11/16/17, 12:48 AM - Blah Blah Blah: How's ur museum group thingy going?
11/16/17, 12:52 AM - Michael Kolber: It's already on the USB, and I'm already in bed :))
11/16/17, 12:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Luckyy
11/16/17, 12:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm editing my research paper
11/19/17, 6:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: asdfghkl
11/19/17, 6:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Sorry, I sneezed on my keyboard
11/19/17, 7:39 PM - Michael Kolber: 1. That's gross
11/19/17, 7:40 PM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
11/19/17, 7:41 PM - Michael Kolber: 3. Impressive that your... fluids managed to only hit keys in the middle row. On a touch-screen phone
11/19/17, 8:21 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Not so healthy to hold it in
11/19/17, 8:21 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Did this happen today? It's a sign
11/19/17, 8:22 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I had a feeling u would comment on that... what can I say I'm very talented, even involuntarily
11/19/17, 8:33 PM - Michael Kolber: Haha true
11/19/17, 8:34 PM - Michael Kolber: And no I had to use Google to find it
11/19/17, 8:34 PM - Michael Kolber: Is involuntary talent really talent or just luckü§î
11/19/17, 8:57 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha thought so, not like u to have snapchat
11/19/17, 8:58 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Involuntary talent is another level of talent that most human minds do not understand
11/19/17, 9:00 PM - Michael Kolber: Maybe I have Snapchat but I just don't have any friends ü§î
11/19/17, 9:00 PM - Michael Kolber: Maybe I'm not human ü§î
11/19/17, 9:06 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That explains why u have no friends
11/19/17, 9:06 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I see you're in a mood
11/19/17, 9:07 PM - Michael Kolber: Or maybe not having friends makes me inhuman ü§î
11/19/17, 9:07 PM - Michael Kolber: Plato's getting to me
11/19/17, 9:10 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U need to move on, we're on Nietzsche now
11/19/17, 9:10 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I just got up to make myself cereal and there was a  bowl of it ready in the kitchen
11/19/17, 9:11 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Should I be scared or happy üòÆ
11/19/17, 9:11 PM - Michael Kolber: Happy because less work
11/19/17, 9:11 PM - Michael Kolber: Scared because your memory's going
11/19/17, 9:11 PM - Michael Kolber: Or neither because you won't remember either
11/19/17, 9:15 PM - Blah Blah Blah: True, making it is such a hassle
11/19/17, 9:15 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What were we talking about again?
11/19/17, 9:18 PM - Michael Kolber: My name for the registration for the new Tesla
11/19/17, 9:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ooh
11/19/17, 9:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Expensive car + cheap college = Great balance
11/19/17, 9:29 PM - Michael Kolber: That's why I'm so glad you agreed to pay for it
11/19/17, 9:35 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats pretty low compared to what I get my other friends
11/19/17, 9:51 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm not so physical
11/19/17, 10:07 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U could totally trade the Tesla for a ◊í◊û◊®◊ê if you'd like
11/19/17, 10:08 PM - Michael Kolber: Already have a full shas ‚ò∫
11/19/17, 10:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Niceüëåüèª
11/19/17, 10:57 PM - Michael Kolber: So just lmk when it's getting here cuz a tree just fell on my car
11/19/17, 11:24 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What a coincidence
11/20/17, 9:16 AM - Michael Kolber: Apparently duct tape also works on cars
11/20/17, 10:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Congrats on your survival
11/20/17, 10:33 AM - Michael Kolber: Hm?
11/20/17, 10:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Your duct taped car
11/20/17, 10:39 AM - Michael Kolber: Ah. Yeah...
11/20/17, 10:39 AM - Michael Kolber: It was kind of hard getting the engine running on tape instead of gas but it liquefied eventually
11/20/17, 10:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Now u could save on gas
11/20/17, 10:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: <Media omitted>
11/20/17, 10:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Go to Michaels and get a bunch of tape
11/20/17, 10:43 AM - Michael Kolber: Michaels is amazing
11/20/17, 10:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Also my professor commented on my pink shirt (and pencil, presumably) üòñ
11/20/17, 10:46 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha oh shoot what did he/she say?
11/20/17, 10:47 AM - Michael Kolber: He asked if I was wearing it because girls like it
11/20/17, 10:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I don't think pink shirts attract girls
11/20/17, 10:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: What'd u say?
11/20/17, 10:55 AM - Michael Kolber: I don't think so either. He also asked me if I'm working in an ice cream shop because apparently girls like ice cream also? He's kinda weird but not in a creepy way. I just told him I'm wearing it because it's linen and comfortable
11/20/17, 10:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha yeah thats why most people wear their clothes
11/20/17, 10:57 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I see what he means  by the ice cream, I went to an ice cream shop once and the guy gave me the ice cream for less than half the price for no reason
11/20/17, 11:10 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but like??? That's such an odd connection to make
11/20/17, 11:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: True, but then again he's a weird professor
11/20/17, 11:13 AM - Michael Kolber: I suppose. Plus pink is still a nice color
11/20/17, 11:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: It is... and apparently a great conversation starter
11/20/17, 11:16 AM - Michael Kolber: Which you so elegantly pioneered
11/20/17, 11:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Another one of my talents‚ò∫
11/20/17, 11:18 AM - Michael Kolber: I remember learning about female pioneers in elementary school
11/20/17, 11:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Sometimes I wonder what goes on in your brain
11/20/17, 11:19 AM - Michael Kolber: You have no idea
11/20/17, 11:20 AM - Michael Kolber: When I have enough coffee I associate enough to make people's heads spin
11/20/17, 11:25 AM - Blah Blah Blah: For the sake of humanity, stay away from coffee
11/20/17, 11:26 AM - Michael Kolber: It's fun tho üòÑ
11/20/17, 11:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm sure each cup lasts a month on u
11/20/17, 11:33 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Are u in class now?
11/20/17, 11:34 AM - Michael Kolber: Yes I am
11/20/17, 11:35 AM - Michael Kolber: I actually slept well last night but was scared I was going to fall asleep in Miceli's class so I had a coffee anyway
11/20/17, 11:35 AM - Michael Kolber: It's so satisfying that divisibility only has one vowel
11/20/17, 11:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And you're texting? I'm such a great influence
11/20/17, 11:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I can tell u had a coffee, but yeah it is satisfying
11/20/17, 11:51 AM - Michael Kolber: Math class is way more interesting this way
11/20/17, 11:58 AM - Blah Blah Blah: ü§ó
11/20/17, 11:58 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I have that effect on things
11/20/17, 11:59 AM - Michael Kolber: You seem to have lots of effects. Like a science experiment with lots of explosions
11/20/17, 12:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ooh like a volcano?
11/20/17, 12:13 PM - Michael Kolber: If God is the scientist then sure
11/20/17, 12:18 PM - Michael Kolber: Smart move of the day: walk through Powdermaker to stay warm while crossing campus
11/20/17, 12:18 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I do that everyday! Best trick ever
11/20/17, 12:38 PM - Michael Kolber: Even when walking to honors hall?
11/20/17, 12:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Every other day**
11/20/17, 12:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Only for teiks class
11/20/17, 12:57 PM - Michael Kolber: Oh. So I do it from the parking lot to philosophy
11/20/17, 1:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So we take turns using it
11/20/17, 1:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Only one of us can have it at a time
11/20/17, 1:16 PM - Michael Kolber: It's a pretty big building...
11/20/17, 1:17 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Maybe I dont want to shareü§î
11/20/17, 1:18 PM - Michael Kolber: I feel like you're going to have to share no matter what. There are people other than me who use the building, you know
11/20/17, 1:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I guess I'm going to speak to an official about this
11/20/17, 1:33 PM - Blah Blah Blah: You seem passionate about this issue
11/20/17, 2:29 PM - Michael Kolber: I'd like to be there to argue my case
11/20/17, 2:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It'll be during your math classüòÑ
11/20/17, 2:43 PM - Michael Kolber: Then I'll text in my arguments :D
11/20/17, 3:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Technology is evil
11/20/17, 3:19 PM - Michael Kolber: You can't say that to me during my CS class
11/20/17, 3:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: You can't stop me
11/20/17, 5:35 PM - Michael Kolber: I can mute you
11/20/17, 5:50 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I could block u first
11/20/17, 5:52 PM - Michael Kolber: You could but that wouldn't stop you
11/20/17, 5:52 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Error Code 404: This AT&amp;T User Is No Longer In Service
11/20/17, 5:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Heh that's so cute using http responses for texts
11/20/17, 5:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: How good is it though?
11/20/17, 5:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm impressed
11/20/17, 5:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Like 2/10
11/20/17, 5:54 PM - Michael Kolber: Being impressed with yourself doesn't even count for a "talent"
11/20/17, 5:54 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U know what I'm going to find someone who appreciates my effort
11/20/17, 5:54 PM - Michael Kolber: I'd take that bet
11/20/17, 6:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I'm patiently waiting for someone to laugh at your joke

11/21/17, 11:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: And thats how u get a villain to admit his plans
11/21/17, 11:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thank u, thank uüëãüèº
11/21/17, 11:11 PM - Michael Kolber: ‚úåüèªü§òüèªüôåüèª
I feel like these are all better options
11/21/17, 11:11 PM - Michael Kolber: And before you ask, yes, they're all the girl versions of the emoji
11/21/17, 11:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I wasn't going to ask
11/21/17, 11:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I've learned to accept it
11/21/17, 11:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: My option is more humble
11/21/17, 11:32 PM - Michael Kolber: Moshe would be proud
11/21/17, 11:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I know, I try

11/22/17, 10:47 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Im ready to entertain
11/22/17, 10:48 AM - Michael Kolber: Nice. How was the flight? Did you fly El Al?
11/22/17, 10:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yup, it was only 9 hours and I slept half the timeüëåüèª
11/22/17, 10:57 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah I noticed it was shorter. That's so odd
11/22/17, 10:58 AM - Michael Kolber: Great way to pass the time on a flight is to just listen to Hamilton
11/22/17, 10:58 AM - Michael Kolber: Highly recommended
11/22/17, 11:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Not odd, amazing
11/22/17, 11:00 AM - Michael Kolber: ^ my tagline
11/22/17, 11:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So I tried listening to Hamilton the other day but I need the video too
11/22/17, 11:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Since when?
11/22/17, 11:01 AM - Michael Kolber: Noooo the point is that the music is amazing
11/22/17, 11:01 AM - Michael Kolber: Since right now
11/22/17, 11:01 AM - Michael Kolber: And doesn't require the show
11/22/17, 11:01 AM - Michael Kolber: It's super confusing until you listen to it like ten times
11/22/17, 11:01 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh I see
11/22/17, 11:01 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But its 2 and a half hours longüòØ
11/22/17, 11:02 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Maybe I'll give it another chance
11/22/17, 11:03 AM - Michael Kolber: It's not for everyone so no pressure. But yeah it's super long
11/22/17, 11:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ok pheww
11/22/17, 11:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I usually like soundtracks after I watch the movie
11/22/17, 11:06 AM - Michael Kolber: True but I always feel like I'm missing out by watching a recording of a live performance
11/22/17, 11:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I hear u
11/22/17, 11:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U should enter the lotteries for the show
11/22/17, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: I used to but it's not really the same without Lin
11/22/17, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: Plus I heard it's only the songs, no dialog. And I already know the music inside out
11/22/17, 11:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh so forget that
11/22/17, 11:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U should audition for the show
11/22/17, 11:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Lin makes everything better
11/22/17, 12:17 PM - Michael Kolber: Because the world needs more white rappers
11/22/17, 12:17 PM - Michael Kolber: He does indeed. Although it's overstated sometimes. I feel like people only went to see Moana because he wrote the music
11/22/17, 12:35 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It's never enough. Start thinking of ur name
11/22/17, 12:35 PM - Blah Blah Blah: For sure, he did a really good job though
11/22/17, 12:49 PM - Michael Kolber: You already came up with it
11/22/17, 12:49 PM - Michael Kolber: That he did
11/22/17, 1:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah I know but I thought u didnt like that name
11/22/17, 1:40 PM - Michael Kolber: I don't but what can I do? It's too perfect
11/22/17, 1:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Another one of my talents haha
11/22/17, 1:43 PM - Michael Kolber: Jeez can we just make a list
11/22/17, 1:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Get some coffee you'll be here a while
11/22/17, 1:56 PM - Michael Kolber: Already had one ‚ò∫
11/22/17, 1:59 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Then we may begin
11/22/17, 2:02 PM - Michael Kolber: You first
11/22/17, 2:18 PM - Blah Blah Blah: No please be my guest
11/22/17, 2:47 PM - Michael Kolber: I don't think you can host me in a country you don't live in
11/22/17, 3:12 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I used to live hereüòä
11/22/17, 3:13 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah? How old were you?

11/22/17, 3:34 PM - Michael Kolber: Do you speak Hebrew well?
11/22/17, 3:38 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Sort of 
At home we speak a mix of russian and hebrew
11/22/17, 3:39 PM - Blah Blah Blah: My russian is a little better
11/22/17, 8:08 PM - Michael Kolber: That's interesting
11/22/17, 9:50 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hows ur Hebrew and Spanish?
11/22/17, 9:50 PM - Michael Kolber: Spanish is excellent. Hebrew is conversational
11/22/17, 9:50 PM - Michael Kolber: Neither are as good as my English, sadly
11/22/17, 9:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Same
11/22/17, 9:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Makes sense
11/22/17, 9:58 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but still
11/22/17, 9:58 PM - Michael Kolber: I practice my Spanish as often as I can
11/22/17, 10:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It's a really good language to know
11/22/17, 10:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Do u ever think in Spanish?
11/22/17, 10:05 PM - Michael Kolber: Especially in America. But Russian is the Spanish of Israel so...
11/22/17, 10:05 PM - Michael Kolber: Occasionally. But only when I've been speaking it a ton
11/22/17, 10:08 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like I'm always in Russian neighborhoods or around Russian ppl so for me Russian comes close to Spanish
11/22/17, 10:09 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So I randomly throw Russian words into my thoughts haha
11/22/17, 10:22 PM - Michael Kolber: Why are you up??
11/22/17, 10:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Didn't sleep so well and I have to be up by 6 today anyway
11/22/17, 10:32 PM - Michael Kolber: wellllll that sucks
11/22/17, 10:32 PM - Michael Kolber: why do you need to be up so early on vacation?
11/22/17, 10:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: We're used to it, my family wakes up at 8 on Sundays
11/22/17, 10:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: There's places to be and people to see but not enough time
11/22/17, 10:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Most of my cousins live here
11/22/17, 10:43 PM - Michael Kolber: Ah, I gotcha
11/22/17, 11:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh hey its almost thanksgiving
11/22/17, 11:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Does ur famiy do anything?
11/22/17, 11:05 PM - Michael Kolber: We do dinner usually but that's about it
11/22/17, 11:05 PM - Michael Kolber: no crazy football parties :)
11/22/17, 11:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Really? I could totally imagine u Lisa Mona and Ginger dressed in team colors and rooting for them
11/22/17, 11:43 PM - Michael Kolber: That's...such an odd picture in my head haha
11/22/17, 11:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha I think we're imagining it differently
11/22/17, 11:54 PM - Michael Kolber: I wonder ü§î
11/22/17, 11:55 PM - Michael Kolber: I'm imagining the cats in matching cheerleader costumes, one red one blue, with pompoms
11/23/17, 12:06 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I was thinking more  green and yellow jerseys
11/23/17, 12:07 AM - Michael Kolber: I see we have a Packers fan
11/23/17, 12:21 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh yeah go Packers
11/23/17, 12:21 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I don't know any teams haha
11/23/17, 12:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Me neither
11/23/17, 12:27 AM - Michael Kolber: I just guessed üò≥
11/23/17, 12:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Same with all my emoji usage
11/23/17, 12:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That's a pretty good guess
11/23/17, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha that explains alot
11/23/17, 12:42 AM - Michael Kolber: üçà
11/23/17, 12:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No comment

11/23/17, 12:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U made a website? For what?
11/23/17, 12:50 AM - Michael Kolber: Also my computer says that WhatsApp web is active. But it isn't. Maybe it's the CIA
11/23/17, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: They're suspicious of your emoji use
11/23/17, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: I made it with some friends at a hackathon. It lets you lend and and borrow items to people in your community
11/23/17, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: Tbh I am too
11/23/17, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats cool
11/23/17, 12:52 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But really who isnt

11/23/17, 12:52 AM - Michael Kolber: It is. We won :D so now we're refining it
11/23/17, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Woah I'm speaking to a person who won the hackathon
11/23/17, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats a game changer
11/23/17, 12:54 AM - Michael Kolber: I won an ENTIRE $10 computer
11/23/17, 12:55 AM - Michael Kolber: And also technically 2 thousand bucks but whatever
11/23/17, 12:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No way
11/23/17, 12:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U planning on sharing with all ur closest friends?
11/23/17, 12:56 AM - Michael Kolber: We're not exactly sure what it is. We originally thought it was 2k towards a charity of our choice but then they said it's the equivalent in consulting? Idk
11/23/17, 12:56 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, if you want web consulting I guess. Or if you want to be a charity ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/23/17, 12:57 AM - Michael Kolber: (almost hit the boy emoji there by mistake)
11/23/17, 12:58 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats really cool
11/23/17, 12:58 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh gosh that would've been a problem
11/23/17, 12:58 AM - Michael Kolber: But I'm far more excited about the computer. It's smaller than a credit card!
11/23/17, 12:59 AM - Michael Kolber: Thankfully I have chihuahua-like reflexes
11/23/17, 12:59 AM - Blah Blah Blah: What kind is it? Whats it for
11/23/17, 12:59 AM - Michael Kolber: Raspberry Pi. And for whatever you want
11/23/17, 12:59 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Only u would make such a reference haha
11/23/17, 1:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: It works like a regular computer ?
11/23/17, 1:01 AM - Michael Kolber: I'd say I try but...this is just my natural me...sigh
11/23/17, 1:01 AM - Michael Kolber: I think? I haven't actually used it yet
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: Hey WhatsApp web stopped. Maybe they caught on to me catching on
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hey it makes life more exciting
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: It really does
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: I would have to be normal
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: Ugh
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: Even thinking about it
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Quick whats your next move
11/23/17, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: I'm gonna throw off
11/23/17, 1:03 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I looked up your tiny computer, my brother would be into that he built his own computer
11/23/17, 1:03 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I know right
11/23/17, 1:03 AM - Michael Kolber: Ooh me too!
11/23/17, 1:04 AM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
11/23/17, 1:04 AM - Michael Kolber: Your brother and I can be friends
11/23/17, 1:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Go for it, he's 15
11/23/17, 1:05 AM - Michael Kolber: You're actually the second person today to tell me about their 15 year old brother who built his own computer
11/23/17, 1:05 AM - Michael Kolber: So how's that for weird
11/23/17, 1:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I would ask about ur computer but idk all the official things
11/23/17, 1:05 AM - Michael Kolber: Also you can get him the computer for Chanukah or something cuz it's only $10 or so, which is pretty reasonable
11/23/17, 1:06 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ur joking, that's crazy
11/23/17, 1:06 AM - Michael Kolber: It's ok that doesn't stop me from telling people
11/23/17, 1:06 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I would but he keeps talking about these new headphones
11/23/17, 1:06 AM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
11/23/17, 1:07 AM - Michael Kolber: That's what parents are for
11/23/17, 1:07 AM - Blah Blah Blah: True true, alright I'm convinced

11/23/17, 1:08 AM - Michael Kolber: True
11/23/17, 1:09 AM - Michael Kolber: I need to get lights for the inside of mine so that you can actually see it and not just the glare. Someday
11/23/17, 1:10 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah he has the lights its really nice
11/23/17, 1:10 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I change the colors everytime I walk byüòä

11/23/17, 1:14 AM - Michael Kolber: What number
11/23/17, 1:14 AM - Michael Kolber: I don't think I have
11/23/17, 1:15 AM - Michael Kolber: I actually didn't read it
11/23/17, 1:15 AM - Michael Kolber: It's that point where I start replying for every message I send because I can't think of how to write so that it's clear what I'm referring to
11/23/17, 1:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha I was just going to comment on that

11/23/17, 1:21 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Your sins are forgven

11/23/17, 1:30 AM - Blah Blah Blah: ü§êü§ê
11/23/17, 1:30 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Does that mean I just dragged myself into the invesigation too
11/23/17, 1:31 AM - Michael Kolber: I hope so. My adhd won't last me through the interrogation and torture sessions
11/23/17, 1:37 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No no no this doesn't work with my schedyle

11/24/17, 1:08 AM - Michael Kolber: Also speaking of shebangs
11/24/17, 1:09 AM - Michael Kolber: This punctuation mark is called the interrobang
11/24/17, 1:12 AM - Michael Kolber: Certain sentences give me the creeps. "10-inch parasitic worms", for example
11/24/17, 1:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I can tell ur tired

11/24/17, 1:43 AM - Blah Blah Blah: It is but its not on the keyboard
11/24/17, 1:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U started with 1 but u never made a 2 or 3
11/24/17, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Depends how inferior your keyboard is
11/24/17, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: No I was saying that it's 1:00, not 2:00

11/24/17, 1:47 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U could make the interrobang a shortcut
11/24/17, 1:48 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah that
11/24/17, 1:48 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah Android is more difficult unfortunately
11/24/17, 1:48 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Google knows I'm in Israel and gives me searches in hebrew, how crazy
11/24/17, 1:48 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I have an android too, always have
11/24/17, 1:48 AM - Michael Kolber: Fueled by the CIA probably
11/24/17, 1:49 AM - Michael Kolber: Wait so then how do I do it???

11/24/17, 1:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I got to shortcuts but it won't let me create it ... probably the doings of the CIA
11/24/17, 1:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but it has a unique flavor also. It doesn't have to be dry
11/24/17, 1:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Haha they're onto you
11/24/17, 1:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That's what the turkey lovers tell me

11/26/17, 1:22 AM - Michael Kolber: Probably. Or maybe it's cuz I don't have friends

11/26/17, 10:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Appreciate it
11/26/17, 10:58 AM - Michael Kolber: Do you really? There's so little emotion behind that text, I'm starting to wonder whether this is all a farce and I'm  just being "taken for a ride", as EJ Kenny points out in his introduction to The _Golden Ass_
11/26/17, 11:01 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Did u memorize this quote?
11/26/17, 11:01 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yes texts are emotionless, thats why we have emojis

11/26/17, 11:03 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well of course face-to-face is better but if ur texing ur best option is to use emojis
11/26/17, 11:03 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So much sass

11/26/17, 11:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But that's just my preference
11/26/17, 1:20 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah well that's how you end up with no middle name
11/26/17, 1:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I like it that way
11/26/17, 1:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: No name, no problem
11/26/17, 1:41 PM - Michael Kolber: Until another Eden Cohen commits a crime
11/26/17, 1:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But he looks so innocent
11/26/17, 1:43 PM - Michael Kolber: There's probably more than one

11/26/17, 1:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That. would. be. Amazing!

11/26/17, 4:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: The world needs more awesome ppl like me
11/26/17, 4:06 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but an army seems a bit... overkill

11/26/17, 4:16 PM - Michael Kolber: I suppose that wouldn't be too bad. What's my cut?

11/26/17, 4:34 PM - Blah Blah Blah: If all in one meal then why the onions
11/26/17, 4:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Because onions go great with cream cheese and lox
11/26/17, 4:54 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh I never had that combination, what am I doing with my life

11/26/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Do you live close to their cousins?
11/26/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Your*
11/26/17, 5:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Everyone's over 18 now so kind of busy
11/26/17, 5:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: My whole mom's side is in israel
11/26/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Mine aren't religious so it's different
11/26/17, 5:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Dad's side is 1 aunt in nj 1 in ny and 2 in israel
11/26/17, 5:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: So arent mine haha
11/26/17, 5:48 PM - Michael Kolber: Oh so then maybe _we're_ different haha
11/26/17, 5:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha yeah let's go with that
11/26/17, 5:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: My cousins used to be religiousish but everyone's slowly going off
11/26/17, 5:49 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah same..
11/26/17, 5:50 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Did u grow up in a religious family?
11/26/17, 5:51 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah. Both my parents are baalei teshuva
11/26/17, 5:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh that's nice
11/26/17, 5:52 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, I like it. It gives me a different perspective on Judaism than most, I think
11/26/17, 5:52 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I hear you
11/26/17, 5:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: My family became religious when I was in 6th or 7th grade
11/26/17, 5:53 PM - Michael Kolber: Wow. That's really late. How was that?
11/26/17, 5:54 PM - Michael Kolber: Late as in late in life for your
11/26/17, 5:54 PM - Michael Kolber: Yoi
11/26/17, 5:54 PM - Michael Kolber: You
11/26/17, 5:54 PM - Blah Blah Blah: ^^ so many fails
11/26/17, 5:55 PM - Michael Kolber: Basically my life
11/26/17, 5:55 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Umm interesting, it's weird because  everyone goes to their parents for direction and they sort of came to us because we were the ones in the religious schools
11/26/17, 5:55 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Does that make sense?
11/26/17, 5:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hey but u dont give up
11/26/17, 5:56 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, I get that. My parents ask us things all the time
11/26/17, 5:56 PM - Michael Kolber: Never :)
11/26/17, 5:57 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ur like the only person who has ever related to that
11/26/17, 5:58 PM - Michael Kolber: Really? How can that be? Lots of people's parents weren't originally religious
11/26/17, 5:59 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I guess, but most of them didn't ask their children they ask a rav
11/26/17, 6:00 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah that's true. Emphasis on family I guess
11/26/17, 6:00 PM - Michael Kolber: My chavruta in Israel became religious with his family.
11/26/17, 6:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That's cute
11/26/17, 6:01 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah. It's always so interesting to me. I can't imagine having such a huge life change so young
11/26/17, 6:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But at the same time it feels like I've been religious forever, I definitely remember when we used to not keep Shabbat but it's been years
11/26/17, 6:02 PM - Michael Kolber: That's interesting
11/26/17, 6:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah so I have a different perspective on things
11/26/17, 6:21 PM - Michael Kolber: How so?
11/26/17, 6:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hard to explain
11/26/17, 6:24 PM - Michael Kolber: That's alright, no pressure :)
11/26/17, 6:25 PM - Michael Kolber: Idk I always feel like my parents got the authentic experience because they chose to be religious
11/26/17, 6:26 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah some people feel that way because they got to see what it was like before
11/26/17, 6:26 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Sometimes I wish I grew up in a religious family
11/26/17, 6:26 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha no pressure, there's just alot to it but thanks :)
11/26/17, 6:27 PM - Michael Kolber: Why?
11/26/17, 6:27 PM - Michael Kolber: I mean I don't feel like I missed out on anything. I like to think I'm a thinking individual who can consider the valid points of different religious viewpoints
11/26/17, 6:28 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Because I feel like there's so much I still don't know and  some things I have to figure out on my own or through others
11/26/17, 6:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Also my parents are bukharian so they have certain values that can contradict religion
11/26/17, 6:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That's really good, then you're not curious about a non-religious lifestyle
11/26/17, 6:31 PM - Michael Kolber: I get that but at the same time isn't that true for almost everyone?
11/26/17, 6:31 PM - Michael Kolber: May I ask like what?
11/26/17, 6:32 PM - Michael Kolber: I am. But like I'm not in a craze to stop being religious
11/26/17, 6:33 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah I've been realizing that lately
11/26/17, 6:33 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Right
11/26/17, 6:34 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeshiva helped me realize this also
11/26/17, 6:34 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Education... they really emphasized college that's why I couldn't go to seminary they thought I would never go to college after it :/
11/26/17, 6:35 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It's really important for them that I get a degree and great job...
11/26/17, 6:35 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah isn't that sort of what it's for
11/26/17, 6:35 PM - Michael Kolber: Ah, I see. That sounds really hard
11/26/17, 6:36 PM - Michael Kolber: Depends who you are
11/26/17, 6:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Also depends on the yeshiva
11/26/17, 6:37 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah I was upset about going to college in the beginning but I've recently started liking it
11/26/17, 6:37 PM - Blah Blah Blah: And the semester is almost over üò∂
11/26/17, 6:39 PM - Michael Kolber: Well you've got 7 semesters left üòÑ
11/26/17, 6:39 PM - Michael Kolber: Maybe you can take a semester to go study in Israel and get some credit in the process
11/26/17, 6:39 PM - Michael Kolber: It's not unheard of
11/26/17, 6:39 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha yeah but it's different, I like our honors group and we're switching it up
11/26/17, 6:41 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That would be amazing
11/26/17, 6:42 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah same :/ but a bunch of us will still be in the Hillel and in the same classes. And you can stay friends with people even out of class. Which group are you in?
11/26/17, 6:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Group A
11/26/17, 6:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U?
11/26/17, 6:43 PM - Michael Kolber: B
11/26/17, 6:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah that's true it's just a different atmosphere
11/26/17, 6:44 PM - Michael Kolber: I really like that we have 3 classes with all the same people. I feel like it's a great way to start college that most freshmen don't get
11/26/17, 6:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yessssss
11/26/17, 6:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: At first I thought it would be awful because we would be around the same people all day but its great
11/26/17, 6:46 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah I was so embarrassed to even look around the room at first. But everyone is so nice
11/26/17, 6:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Are u kidding
11/26/17, 6:49 PM - Blah Blah Blah: You're a social butterfly
11/26/17, 6:50 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but I'm really shy also
11/26/17, 6:50 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I guess everyone is in some way
11/26/17, 6:51 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, maybe...
I'm just worried that it comes off as pompousness
11/26/17, 6:52 PM - Michael Kolber: Or more supercilious really
11/26/17, 6:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U and ur vocab
11/26/17, 6:53 PM - Michael Kolber: What
11/26/17, 6:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I get what ur saying, makes sense
11/26/17, 6:55 PM - Blah Blah Blah: It's great
11/26/17, 6:55 PM - Michael Kolber: My vocab?
11/26/17, 6:55 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yup
11/26/17, 6:55 PM - Michael Kolber: Why thank you
11/26/17, 6:56 PM - Michael Kolber: I have a great pic from one time
11/26/17, 6:56 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Don't get used to it

11/26/17, 7:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Really?
11/26/17, 7:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I know it for dramatic quotes
11/26/17, 7:03 PM - Michael Kolber: Right so they come hand in hand
11/26/17, 7:03 PM - Michael Kolber: Thinks like identifying as animals
11/26/17, 7:03 PM - Michael Kolber: And identifying as a different age
11/26/17, 7:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ah I see
11/26/17, 7:04 PM - Michael Kolber: It's just a bit...extreme for me
11/26/17, 7:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I never go on tumblr
11/26/17, 7:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Twitter is great... depending on the person
11/26/17, 7:04 PM - Michael Kolber: Me neither. I just get the best tidbits from reddit üòÖ
11/26/17, 7:04 PM - Michael Kolber: I never got into Twitter
11/26/17, 7:05 PM - Michael Kolber: But I know some great accounts
http://twitter.com/asemgirlsays
11/26/17, 7:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh another trick like going through powdermaker in the cold, a list is growing
11/26/17, 7:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh I dont have it I just look up the funny people
11/26/17, 7:06 PM - Michael Kolber: But why actually dig through stuff when you can just lazily browse other people's curation?
11/26/17, 7:06 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha I didn't know this existed
11/26/17, 7:06 PM - Michael Kolber: Facebook also has some good ones
11/26/17, 7:07 PM - Michael Kolber: Halachot you've never heard of because they're false
11/26/17, 7:07 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Cuz I'm lazy when it comes to everything else I have to put effort into something
11/26/17, 7:07 PM - Michael Kolber: Hmm so maybe you can curate my humor for me
11/26/17, 7:07 PM - Blah Blah Blah: This could be a great category in jeopardy
11/26/17, 7:08 PM - Michael Kolber: Haha yeah
11/26/17, 7:08 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Not that much effortüòÖ
11/26/17, 7:08 PM - Michael Kolber: Wow ok then

12/24/17, 3:51 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I was just talkin to bella and she asked if I worked on the website with u yet, for python, but I didn't realize she wanted me to tell u my ideaass ummm i dont really remember them now unless i see the site... only if u want some  feedback tho
12/25/17, 5:24 PM - Michael Kolber: yeah, I always love feedback. The thing is I just started designing a totally new one
12/25/17, 5:24 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ooh why'd u get rid of the other one?
12/25/17, 5:46 PM - Michael Kolber: I didn't get rid of it, I just didn't love it so much
12/25/17, 5:47 PM - Michael Kolber: http://michaelkolber.com/ltp-website/index.html
12/25/17, 5:59 PM - Blah Blah Blah: This is the one I saw, its the old one right?

12/25/17, 9:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Did Bella tell u she almost has a logo finalized?
12/25/17, 9:55 PM - Michael Kolber: no, she didn't
12/25/17, 10:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh well I dont think its confidential soo basically the colors r red/hot pinkish and white so I think the website should have that similar color scheme
12/25/17, 10:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: What do u think?
12/25/17, 10:02 PM - Michael Kolber: I was designing it around Python colors but that works too. Changing the colors is really easy anyway

12/26/17, 3:22 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Right ya I didn't like that the pic was reapeating but I liked that it took up a lot of space at the top

3/8/18, 10:57 PM - Michael Kolber: Do a close reading
3/8/18, 10:57 PM - Michael Kolber: develop a claim
3/8/18, 10:57 PM - Michael Kolber: if you ask me it defeats the purpose ;)

3/8/18, 11:14 PM - Michael Kolber: I think we had this convo already
3/8/18, 11:14 PM - Michael Kolber: and I had a witty response to that
3/8/18, 11:14 PM - Michael Kolber: but now I can't find it

3/8/18, 11:14 PM - Blah Blah Blah: are u high? on lemons?
3/8/18, 11:24 PM - Michael Kolber: watch it bub
3/8/18, 11:24 PM - Michael Kolber: lemons are great
3/8/18, 11:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Bro...bub... are u trying to imply something lol
3/8/18, 11:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: its actually amazing how u started a lemon movement
3/8/18, 11:32 PM - Michael Kolber: I was just thinking about that actually
3/8/18, 11:32 PM - Michael Kolber: I sort of pushed it but everyone in the group really rallied around it
3/8/18, 11:33 PM - Michael Kolber: I think that's sort of how politics works. Woodrow Wilson was a major isolationist, yes, but he's only known for that because tons of people followed him and supported the idea on their own
3/8/18, 11:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah its really interesting
3/8/18, 11:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I think its because everyone wanted u to get that lemon to kayla and since it took so long we just kept talking about it for days and days
3/8/18, 11:38 PM - Michael Kolber: that was all muneeb
3/8/18, 11:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: He probably deserves a lemon then, no?
3/9/18, 12:07 AM - Michael Kolber: Go for it, nobody's stopping you
3/9/18, 12:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That's quite encouraging, are we still talking about the lemon?
3/9/18, 12:22 AM - Michael Kolber: always
3/9/18, 12:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Why this obsession with lemons?
3/9/18, 12:27 AM - Michael Kolber: üòâüòâ

3/12/18, 11:13 PM - Michael Kolber: That makes him even more masculine. He doesn't even take women into account. His life is all man.

3/12/18, 11:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Everyones living a lie

3/12/18, 11:19 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Then who even needs wpmen anymore
3/12/18, 11:19 PM - Michael Kolber: Women. Duh

5/22/18, 12:54 AM - Michael Kolber: Which is usually
5/22/18, 12:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Why are there humongous spiders all around my house
5/22/18, 12:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I may or may not have sent them to fight for the human race

5/22/18, 1:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its as if he's writing it about you
5/22/18, 1:15 AM - Blah Blah Blah: "The TRUTH About Spiders" Starring Michael Kolber
5/22/18, 1:15 AM - Michael Kolber: Yesssssss
5/22/18, 1:15 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I can already see it selling out everywhere
5/22/18, 1:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: at this rate we might have to go on broadway
5/22/18, 1:43 AM - Michael Kolber: I hate performing
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Also, I just decided that today isn't Tuesday
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: It can't be
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Bc it was just the weekens
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: So today must be Sunday
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: omg what? i loooove it
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: but today is a new today because its past 12 so really its monday
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Ew ew ew. Hate it so much. I don't like attention
5/22/18, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Fine but still not Tuesday
5/22/18, 1:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: if ur okay with going to history on a monday then so be it
5/22/18, 1:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: ohhh i see where this is coming from, BUT, hear me out, when ur doing something u reallllyyy like then performing is so fun
5/22/18, 1:47 AM - Michael Kolber: I'm not ok with going to history on Tuesday either
5/22/18, 1:48 AM - Michael Kolber: I reallllly like singing but I don't like performing singing
5/22/18, 1:48 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well after tomorrow ull never have to go to history again
5/22/18, 1:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I just realized i have the most awkward tan line ever
5/22/18, 1:49 AM - Michael Kolber: Perfect
5/22/18, 1:49 AM - Michael Kolber: How so?
5/22/18, 1:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh I see, well for me performing is just a way i get to share what i reaaalllyyyy like u know? make sense?
5/22/18, 1:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I was wearing leggings earlier and they were midcalf and so half my leg is tan and the other is regular, super fun
5/22/18, 1:51 AM - Michael Kolber: I understand but I can't relate. Like the way I share is by participating with others, not by being watched
5/22/18, 1:51 AM - Michael Kolber: Hm, not a swastika tan line but still pretty awkward. I'd say wear jeggings for the rest of the week to make it less awk
5/22/18, 1:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: What do u mean participate with others? like in what way? also i feel like u get more opportunities to sing than i do to dance haha
5/22/18, 1:52 AM - Michael Kolber: Like if I'm singing the way I'd share is by singing together with others, not by singing _for_ others per se
5/22/18, 1:52 AM - Blah Blah Blah: great idea except what if its 90 degress, is it better to have an awkward tan or be boiling hot hmmm
5/22/18, 1:52 AM - Michael Kolber: Jeggings tho
5/22/18, 1:53 AM - Blah Blah Blah: u do have a point
5/22/18, 1:53 AM - Blah Blah Blah: ohh i seee, feel like its kinda different but yeah sharing it is really fun too
5/22/18, 1:57 AM - Michael Kolber: I don't dance so I'll take your word for it :)
5/22/18, 1:59 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Or maybe u should try dancing haha
5/22/18, 1:59 AM - Michael Kolber: Oh I've tried
5/22/18, 1:59 AM - Michael Kolber: My body just doesn't
5/22/18, 1:59 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha no way!
5/22/18, 2:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I have to see this

5/22/18, 2:03 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But hey that's a talent of its own lol
5/22/18, 2:03 AM - Michael Kolber: I wish I could say I try
5/22/18, 2:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well u can start saying it
5/22/18, 2:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No one will even know
5/22/18, 2:08 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but then they'd find out eventually
5/22/18, 2:08 AM - Michael Kolber: Plus it would be disingenuous
5/22/18, 2:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ooh true
5/22/18, 2:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well i guess just avoid that topic all together
5/22/18, 2:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And talk about spiders!
5/22/18, 2:09 AM - Michael Kolber: Um

5/22/18, 10:14 PM - Michael Kolber: This thing is more powerful than I'll ever need. It's almost a waste of money
5/22/18, 10:15 PM - Blah Blah Blah: haha *almost*
5/22/18, 10:15 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Why do u need such a powerful system?
5/22/18, 10:16 PM - Michael Kolber: I got greedy when building it ü§ì
5/22/18, 10:16 PM - Michael Kolber: Basically I had chosen all the parts and then I went to this store and they had better parts for the same price
5/22/18, 10:17 PM - Michael Kolber: And I was like "well I already put aside the money, may as well get all the better ones"
So I did
And now I have a computer with 16GB of RAM, and I've only ever used 8 at once, as well as a processor so fast that it's spoiled me when buying computers
5/22/18, 10:18 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh nice!! thats totally reasonable, no judgement there

5/23/18, 1:59 AM - Michael Kolber: From Michael Kolber:

*I would like to get Essie something for helping us throughout the year with everything*, a cake or a gift basket. Price range would be $25-$30, which is less than a dollar per person if everyone chips in. If you would like to give any amount at all, please PM me. You can do cash or I'll set up a venmo account or something similar. If you can give a bit more than a dollar to cover the people who won't be able to contribute that would be great!

I plan on giving it to her tomorrow, probably after 3:45 but perhaps at around 1:15. I'll let everyone know by then.

6/4/18, 12:22 AM - Michael Kolber: Like take your weight in pounds, halve it, and drink that much in fluid ounces?
6/4/18, 12:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Mm something like tht
6/4/18, 12:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its a while mathematical equation
6/4/18, 12:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I can find out ur oz per day one sec

9/16/18, 3:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I was gonna say that too
9/16/18, 3:31 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But u should definitely look into some cameras first

9/16/18, 3:34 PM - Blah Blah Blah: No, I don't
9/16/18, 3:34 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But I'm going to nod my head and pretend I do

9/16/18, 3:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Right yeah prob not
9/16/18, 3:40 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Are u thinking of getting this first one as just a starter?
9/16/18, 3:42 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but since even low end cameras are expensive I'd rather spend a bit more on a better one that will last me longer
9/16/18, 3:42 PM - Michael Kolber: Also you know you've been in bed on your phone too long when your battery is almost done and you started at 100% just a few hours ago üò¨

9/16/18, 10:05 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Lol i can relate

9/16/18, 10:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Some ppl r so talented i dnt get it
9/16/18, 10:17 PM - Michael Kolber: I sorta get it. It's something you have a knack for and you build on it naturally. I don't know how to draw, but I also don't have a knack for it so I never had the inclination to teach myself. But with music, I have some sort of natural ability with that, which inspired me to teach myself more about it
9/16/18, 10:17 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ahh yeah good point
9/16/18, 10:18 PM - Blah Blah Blah: U gotta love it otherwise u lose ur motivation or dont even start to begin with

9/16/18, 10:30 PM - Michael Kolber: Which is fine, I'm ok with not drawing
9/16/18, 10:39 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Lol yeah same

9/16/18, 10:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah looked into it
9/16/18, 10:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ur taking it right?
9/16/18, 10:47 PM - Blah Blah Blah: In the one day that i was in 191 we had to draw but no techniques taught
9/16/18, 10:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Yes I am
9/16/18, 10:47 PM - Michael Kolber: It's all carbon and willow though, like shading and all that stuff

9/16/18, 11:36 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeeaahh

9/29/18, 8:14 PM - Michael Kolber: I tried**** to teach you
9/29/18, 8:15 PM - Michael Kolber: You were just not receptive
9/29/18, 8:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Whhattt
9/29/18, 8:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: The student has clearly become the master
9/29/18, 8:16 PM - Blah Blah Blah: pfftt
9/29/18, 8:17 PM - Michael Kolber: That's not how this works...
9/29/18, 8:18 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Well u didnt clarify that
9/29/18, 8:23 PM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
9/29/18, 8:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Then everything would cost much less
9/29/18, 8:32 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Im in
9/29/18, 8:39 PM - Michael Kolber: not necessarily
9/29/18, 8:39 PM - Michael Kolber: Price per pound would still be different for different items
9/29/18, 8:40 PM - Michael Kolber: But it would just be explicitly per pound
9/29/18, 8:40 PM - Michael Kolber: So like gold is one of the most valuable things in existence, and it's sold by weight
9/29/18, 8:41 PM - Michael Kolber: But like computers would be sold by weight. Lego, chocolate, chairs, class supplies, tuition, airplane tickets, prostitutes, vacuum cleaners, books, knives, cars. All of it. Even scales.
9/29/18, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Well yeah that makes sense because the gold itself has so much value
9/29/18, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Other objects are basically worthless universally
9/29/18, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Its all subjective
9/29/18, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah this list omgüòÇ
9/29/18, 8:46 PM - Blah Blah Blah: "The Mind of Michael"

9/29/18, 8:52 PM - Michael Kolber: Yes
9/29/18, 8:52 PM - Michael Kolber: They charge you based on how much you weigh
9/29/18, 8:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah ooo
9/29/18, 8:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That would not fly well in america
9/29/18, 8:53 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Pun intended

9/30/18, 12:05 AM - Michael Kolber: I use InDesign for page layouts, but Illustrator is way better for editing vectors
9/30/18, 12:05 AM - Michael Kolber: Yep!
9/30/18, 12:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Look at uuuu barely a month and he's already a professional pfft
9/30/18, 12:06 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I rlly like the decisions u made with the words, its always hard for me to come up with stuff
9/30/18, 12:06 AM - Michael Kolber: This is practically all I did in my internship this past summer
9/30/18, 12:07 AM - Michael Kolber: Thank you! This is easier than the last one, where we had to use shapes to represent emotions. That one I just hated, it was too abstract
9/30/18, 12:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: no way, that sounds like such a fun internship
9/30/18, 12:09 AM - Blah Blah Blah: haha yeah u rlly gotta think out of the box with these, need to get used to that way of thinking
9/30/18, 12:10 AM - Michael Kolber: it actually was, especially bc I knew more about this than my boss :D
9/30/18, 12:10 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, it's definitely a matter of practice

9/30/18, 12:12 AM - Blah Blah Blah: 100% and its fun to do so not even a problem lol
9/30/18, 12:13 AM - Michael Kolber: he didn't really care. he didn't seem very intent on learning anything new. to be fair, everything that I learned, I learned over that summer of right before, so it wasn't like he couldn't. he'd just rather spend all day browsing twitter, facebook, and linkedin
9/30/18, 12:13 AM - Michael Kolber: it's ok for me. not FUN per se but not boring either. I feel like I'd enjoy photography a lot more, or illustration. This is too dry for em
9/30/18, 12:13 AM - Michael Kolber: me
9/30/18, 12:15 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ah interesting, what kind of company was it lol
9/30/18, 12:16 AM - Michael Kolber: Software dev. Not going to go into too much detail bc you don't need to know who he is
9/30/18, 12:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I like the editing and creation process, still need to get the hang of photography, also what do u mean by illustration? In what way
9/30/18, 12:16 AM - Michael Kolber: Like photo editing processing you're saying?
9/30/18, 12:16 AM - Michael Kolber: Illustration like drawing things but on the computer
9/30/18, 12:16 AM - Michael Kolber: Like a coffee mug or something similar
9/30/18, 12:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: haha nah totally not
9/30/18, 12:17 AM - Michael Kolber: I really like this style of illustration

10/9/18, 3:32 PM - Michael Kolber: Studies have shown that chronically losing sleep (less than six hours per night) leads to poorer performance on cognitive ability tests. After a month or so to recoup (getting eight hours), test results returned to normal.

Studies on those with more severe sleep deprivation (chronically getting less than four hours per night) showed that test scores did not improve after three months of normal sleep. Even long term studies found that test scores did not fully improve in those subjects before the study ended.

Edit: while people are paying attention. The study also demonstrated that after a few weeks of reduced sleep, those getting less than six hours reported feeling perfectly capable of performing. They felt as if they had "adjusted" to fewer hours of sleep. Their tests, however, showed that they had not. So even if you feel like you don't need sleep, you still need sleep.

Edit 2: It is an average, not a rule. People vary from 7ish hours to 8.5ish. Age also matters. We appear to need less sleep as we age. Or we still need it but don't get it. Either way, you sleep less as you age.

Edit 3: SciShow playlist about sleep

Edit 4: Wish I could answer all your questions, but I'm not a scientist. I'm just a guy who had a lot of trouble getting to sleep so I read up on stuff about it.

Edit 5: "What about people who get like 4 hours of sleep and claim to be fine and seem to be fine?"

Everyone is different, scientists don't exactly understand why some people need more and some need less. Also, as I said the research indicates that while they may feel like they don't need as much sleep, they probably are not performing as well cognitively as they think they are.

"What about that schedule where you sleep for an hour or two at a time multiple times per day?"

I haven't seen any literature on it that I trust. I'm not a scientist but my opinion is that it's bullshit. Again, just because you feel like you're getting enough sleep doesn't mean you are.

"What about that time when I pulled like three all-nighters in a row?"

We're talking about chronic lack of sleep. Missing sleep a few times isn't going to permanently affect you, probably.

"What about depression and other mood disorders?"

Depression is comorbid with insomnia and other sleep problems. Are they causally linked? Probably not, they are probably both symptoms of the same chemical imbalance in your brain. That said, losing sleep can make you feel terrible which certainly isn't going to help with your depression. Personally, I have bad feedback loops with anxiety, where not getting enough sleep makes me anxious and then I have an anxiety attack at night because I'm worried that I'm not going to sleep well so I can't get to sleep so I have an anxiety attack because I'm worried that I'll have an anxiety attack and not sleep well which causes me to have anxiety...

"I'm fucked, aren't I?"

I dunno. Probably not. Go get good sleep. Practice good sleep hygiene. Report back in a few years and let us know how it turned out.

Side note

We're talking about very slight drops in cognitive ability, not some huge dip from Einstein to sack of bricks.

"I have a newborn..."

Oh, yeah, you're definitely fucked.

10/9/18, 3:42 PM - Michael Kolber: I'd assume oversleep for a while, then step it back slowly. If you feel the same, great. If you feel slower or worse then you know you've hit your limit
10/9/18, 3:42 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But if u oversleep for a while then ur body will get used to all that sleep

11/8/18, 12:34 AM - Michael Kolber: so she didn't make the class?
11/8/18, 12:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: do u know that some ppl only have registration tomorrow? like wat class can they possibly get? the history of tablecloths like whaat

11/8/18, 12:35 AM - Michael Kolber: haha
11/8/18, 12:35 AM - Michael Kolber: ........
I can only blame her

And the nepotistic system of allowing honors students to register early for no reason
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: haaha shhhhh
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Michael Kolber: I saiddddddddddddddddd
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: whose side r u on
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Michael Kolber: the moral one
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: do u not enjoy early registration
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: u shouldnt have it if u dont appreciate it
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: but she diddddddddddd
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Michael Kolber: In the way I might enjoy ice cream that was stolen from a kid
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Michael Kolber: apparently notttttttttttttttttttttttt
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: well if ur going to steal why would it be ice cream from a kid
11/8/18, 12:36 AM - Michael Kolber: you shouldn't have it period
11/8/18, 12:37 AM - Michael Kolber: there's no reason for us to get early registration
11/8/18, 12:37 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i hear what ur saying
11/8/18, 12:37 AM - Blah Blah Blah: but we did suffer through fhp did we not
11/8/18, 12:37 AM - Michael Kolber: unless you want to say that we put in more work and therefore we get it
but then what about the people who weren't accepted into honors programs
11/8/18, 12:37 AM - Michael Kolber: bc ice cream is great and kids are pushovers. good analogy?
11/8/18, 12:37 AM - Blah Blah Blah: ooo u rlly thought about this, i mean technically premed ppl work rllllyy hard so theres tht
11/8/18, 12:38 AM - Michael Kolber: yeah but enough that some people don't get into a class two semesters in a row?
11/8/18, 12:38 AM - Blah Blah Blah: two opinions right there, weak argument
11/8/18, 12:38 AM - Michael Kolber: kids are literal pushovers, that's not an opinion
11/8/18, 12:38 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i mean why blame honors, apparently presidents of clubs also have early registration
11/8/18, 12:39 AM - Michael Kolber: yeah and ambassadors and student senators
11/8/18, 12:39 AM - Michael Kolber: and staff probably
11/8/18, 12:39 AM - Michael Kolber: and FYI

11/8/18, 12:40 AM - Michael Kolber: it's a small thing that barely knows how to balance, you blow hard enough on it an it'll do a somersault by mistake. that's what a pushover is
11/8/18, 12:40 AM - Michael Kolber: it's stupid
11/8/18, 12:41 AM - Michael Kolber: anyway are there no other music 1 classes for her to take?

1/14/19, 11:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: its very similar to photoshop tho
1/14/19, 11:23 PM - Michael Kolber: I actually didn't use photoshop but yeah
1/14/19, 11:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: i got rlly excited when i created the silhoutte
1/14/19, 11:23 PM - Blah Blah Blah: lightroom?

1/14/19, 11:49 PM - Michael Kolber: no this was photoshop haha
1/14/19, 11:50 PM - Michael Kolber: lightroom can't do that, I had to isolate the swan and its reflection

1/14/19, 11:51 PM - Michael Kolber: 191
1/14/19, 11:52 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I took that in the summer so it was rushed and i kinda dont remember so much ahh

1/23/19, 12:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha woah how did that happen
1/23/19, 12:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Michaeelllll
1/23/19, 12:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I need advice
1/23/19, 12:31 AM - Michael Kolber: What's up
1/23/19, 12:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I have this friend who has a lot of mutual friends as me and i dnt wanna be involved with her so much anymore
1/23/19, 12:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: What to do
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: I was like "Oh, shoot I better not forget to check my messages. She's def gonna text back right away. Nah, I'm right at my computer, how could I forget to check my messages?" And yet here we are 18 minutes later.........
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: But yeah
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: This is super hard. This happened to me a few times
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahahaha
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ur the best
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like u have so much wisdom
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: üòä
1/23/19, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: More like so many failings
1/23/19, 12:52 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That are now very helpful
1/23/19, 12:54 AM - Michael Kolber: But I think the best course of action is to just slowly stop interacting with her so much. I'm actually going through this right now come to think of it. This friend of mine shares lots of friends with me, but I just don't like her. I don't think she's nice. So I just sort of stopped connecting with her so much. I'm still polite, I just don't go out of my way to share funny pics with her or things like that, and slowly we've stopped talking as much, which is good for me. And once school starts I'll see her, and I'll talk with her if she talks to me, make small talk, but that's it. Remember that all friendships are two-sided, you get to choose how it works just as much as they do.
1/23/19, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Omg saaaame
1/23/19, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Shes just not nice either
1/23/19, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And she makes me feel awful and friends shouldnt do that
1/23/19, 12:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Yep, same here ;/
1/23/19, 12:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah so i cut off as soon as break started and she noticed so i told her i want some distance but we ended up hanging out last week cuz some friends invited her (üò£) and she was being awful to me but idk why bc she literally told me a couple days before that she misses me
1/23/19, 12:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Kinda worried about going back now bc wr have class together:/
1/23/19, 12:56 AM - Michael Kolber: Maybe she just doesn't realize?
1/23/19, 12:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: She was purposely avoiding me in a way
1/23/19, 12:56 AM - Michael Kolber: Not that it makes it excusable, but I'm saying just for your peace of mind...
1/23/19, 12:56 AM - Michael Kolber: Ah
1/23/19, 12:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha ah i see
1/23/19, 12:57 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like i need to change perspective but its so hard
1/23/19, 12:57 AM - Michael Kolber: What are you worried about? Having to see her?
1/23/19, 12:57 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Just being in class with her idk how its going to turn out
1/23/19, 12:59 AM - Michael Kolber: Ah gotcha. How about a direct approach? If she asks you, tell her "I'm sorry, but I don't like how you treat me, and I'd rather not hang out with you if you're going to make me feel bad, because that's not what friends do."
And if she doesn't ask you, then just sort of let things be. Don't go out of your way to be friendly to her, just be polite.
1/23/19, 1:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So I've spoken to her about this and things improved but recently i realized that its not just the way she acts but like there's always drama and negativity with her
1/23/19, 1:02 AM - Michael Kolber: I see. So you don't want her to think that it's just the way she acts
1/23/19, 1:02 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean I guess
1/23/19, 1:02 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Idk Ive just really felt a difference once we stopped talking for a while
1/23/19, 1:03 AM - Michael Kolber: So what do you want to do? Do you want to cut off all contact completely? Or just not be friends? Or something else?
1/23/19, 1:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean
1/23/19, 1:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont think I want to be as close as before, I sort of just wanna be friendly
1/23/19, 1:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh sorry for the delayüòÖ
1/23/19, 1:37 AM - Michael Kolber: It's ok :)
1/23/19, 1:37 AM - Michael Kolber: Ok, so just do it and let things happen. What are you worried about?
1/23/19, 1:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: All these plans in making with friends involve her in some way and i just don't want her to be a part of every single thing i do but thats what it feels like
1/23/19, 1:43 AM - Michael Kolber: Ah, I see. And you can't go to these events and just not interact with her?
1/23/19, 1:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: The last one was awful but it was also a smaller group of ppl
1/23/19, 1:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I guess i can see how the next thing goes
1/23/19, 1:44 AM - Michael Kolber: True. And you can also see who's invited and excuse yourself if it's an issue
1/23/19, 1:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah but im also hosting a superbowl party so cant excuse myself for that haha
1/23/19, 1:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: K im gonna head to sleep bc sooooooo tired
1/23/19, 1:50 AM - Michael Kolber: ah yeah...
1/23/19, 1:50 AM - Michael Kolber: sleep well :)

2/10/19, 8:27 PM - Michael Kolber: Explain to her why you don't feel happy with the relationship, and see if you guys can work on it. And if you can't then don't be afraid to tell her that you'd rather not be friends
2/10/19, 8:28 PM - Michael Kolber: You deserve to be happy as much as she does
2/10/19, 8:28 PM - Blah Blah Blah: 100% agree

2/10/19, 8:31 PM - Michael Kolber: hahaha
2/10/19, 8:32 PM - Michael Kolber: I find it helpful to remind myself that I won't enjoy not speaking up in the long run, and the person I'm speaking to would probably also prefer that I be straight with them
2/10/19, 8:32 PM - Michael Kolber: And a piece of advice -- go do something to take your mind off of this, don't stress about it for the next half hour :)
2/10/19, 8:33 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yes totally agree, everyone prefers the straight frwd approach i tend to go in circles but thts bc im worried about how the person is going to react
2/10/19, 8:33 PM - Blah Blah Blah: but i guess if i do it a certain way it can work

2/12/19, 2:25 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I wanna do a design major but i want something to fall back on just in case
2/12/19, 2:29 PM - Michael Kolber: Hmm
So I believe that if you did a design major and a CS minor then you could theoretically fall back on it for a web design job
2/12/19, 2:29 PM - Michael Kolber: But you'd have to teach yourself lots of web coding
2/12/19, 2:29 PM - Michael Kolber: Wanna call?
2/12/19, 2:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yesssssss

2/12/19, 4:59 PM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
2/12/19, 4:59 PM - Blah Blah Blah: üò±üò±üò±
2/12/19, 5:00 PM - Michael Kolber: You _can_ but do you really want to? I bet I could go to med school and do the work, but I just don't want to. It won't make me happy
2/12/19, 5:00 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean I thought I wanted to
2/12/19, 5:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: For me physical therapy is like a step into the medical field
2/12/19, 5:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Like ill still be doing something medical but not as intense
2/12/19, 5:02 PM - Michael Kolber: And you want to do medical?
2/12/19, 5:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: No im terrified of everything in that fieldüòÖ
2/12/19, 5:03 PM - Michael Kolber: hahaha so why
2/12/19, 5:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Buttt thats why pt is good
2/12/19, 5:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah i have an explanation
2/12/19, 5:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: <Media omitted>
2/12/19, 7:37 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I think I figured it out
2/12/19, 8:43 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah I sort of get that. But being in that less involved practice, would you be as happy? Not saying you wouldn't, I don't know. I'm just wondering
2/12/19, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: idk if i would be happy
2/12/19, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: i cant tell
2/12/19, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: i told my mom my plan and she isnt happy, they only want me to do the medical field
2/12/19, 8:45 PM - Blah Blah Blah: so i cant really win
2/12/19, 8:46 PM - Michael Kolber: Why? They're worried you won't make enough money?
2/12/19, 8:47 PM - Michael Kolber: Why don't you try interning at a PT place? And do another summer interning as a marketing person. I might be able to get you a job in marketing
2/12/19, 8:48 PM - Michael Kolber: But try PT first because you're not sure you enjoy it
2/12/19, 8:49 PM - Michael Kolber: Also btw, design major does not always mean graphic designer. If you work hard and hone your talent you can be something like a creative director, and they make way more money
2/12/19, 9:01 PM - Blah Blah Blah: That or wont get a job
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Michael Kolber: Ehhhhh
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Michael Kolber: I don't think that's true but I'm a college student so what do I know
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah i found a whole bunch of advertising/marketing internships earlier and got rlly excited lol
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont think its true either
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Michael Kolber: Haha. I have one nearby that pays well
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Michael Kolber: But ^^
2/12/19, 9:02 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Should I stick with bio and do an internship during this semester maybe? With the risk of bio destroying my gpa
2/12/19, 9:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Oooo the place u worked at?
2/12/19, 9:03 PM - Michael Kolber: Yes
2/12/19, 9:03 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha yeah i looked into it its nuts
2/12/19, 9:03 PM - Michael Kolber: Idk? Would your parents mind if you dropped it?
2/12/19, 9:03 PM - Michael Kolber: If not then drop it and try to take web design
2/12/19, 9:04 PM - Michael Kolber: If you can't then use the extra time to learn web design on your own
2/12/19, 9:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: If i wanna do pt i have to take 5 sciences in 4 semesters
2/12/19, 9:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: + stat
2/12/19, 9:04 PM - Blah Blah Blah: + a major

2/12/19, 9:06 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like it looks bad otherwise
2/12/19, 9:06 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah bc you need to get promoted into the position usually. Or you need job experience
2/12/19, 9:07 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Ah not bad
2/12/19, 9:07 PM - Michael Kolber: I don't think so.......
2/12/19, 9:07 PM - Michael Kolber: You can explain that you were taking time to decide what your actually wanted to do and you're glad you did because it helped you realize how much you wanted to be x

2/13/19, 12:07 AM - Blah Blah Blah: This is a free show right?
2/13/19, 12:08 AM - Michael Kolber: Do you want my advice or do you want me to tell you what you want to hear? :)
2/13/19, 12:08 AM - Michael Kolber: lol no it's costing me my sanity
2/13/19, 12:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Uh oh
2/13/19, 12:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Both plz
2/13/19, 12:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: üòÇ i can afford that
2/13/19, 12:08 AM - Michael Kolber: ha I can't
2/13/19, 12:11 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah i can pay for u this one time
2/13/19, 12:12 AM - Michael Kolber: What you probably want me to say is "Tell her you can't tomorrow, that you don't have the time, and anytime she asks just keep telling her you can't. It's the least confrontational way."

What you don't want to hear is "Tell her that you're sorry but you don't think it's a good idea for you guys to be doing things like that. Apologize if you weren't clear earlier, but you think you need real space and time to process what sort of relationship you two have. It's not going to be easy but this way you don't leave her thinking there's a relationship that you don't believe in, but you also don't cut off the possibility of being friends ever again. And this way is likely better for both of you."
2/13/19, 12:13 AM - Michael Kolber: right you and what sanity
2/13/19, 12:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oo
2/13/19, 12:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I didnt expect that
2/13/19, 12:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hm
2/13/19, 12:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: She told me she has a meeting till 1 so i said itll prob go overtime
2/13/19, 12:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Cuz i know the person
2/13/19, 12:14 AM - Michael Kolber: Ok
2/13/19, 12:14 AM - Michael Kolber: but you're making excuses and avoiding the actual problem...
2/13/19, 12:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Bc i cant say those words
2/13/19, 12:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: If i say it she'll hate me
2/13/19, 12:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I know avishag
2/13/19, 12:16 AM - Michael Kolber: And if you don't say it then she's gonna think you guys are friends when you're not. And when she finds out, will she hate you more than if you had just told her?
2/13/19, 12:16 AM - Michael Kolber: The way I see it, being told by someone that they feel they can't be friends with you is really hurtful, but far less hurtful than feeling betrayed by someone because they told you they can be friends when they really can't.
2/13/19, 12:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: What is there to find out
2/13/19, 12:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Why can't we drift apart
2/13/19, 12:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right i hear :/
2/13/19, 12:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But i wanna be friendly
2/13/19, 12:17 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont want to be where we were before
2/13/19, 12:21 AM - Michael Kolber: Because she's trying to still be mamash friends with you, and you're trying to not be friends with her, so you're going away from her and she's going towards you. So you're not drifting apart, you're just moving in the same direction and she's trying to play catch-up
2/13/19, 12:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel so bad üòü
2/13/19, 12:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But i really cant confront her
2/13/19, 12:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its rlly a bad idea
2/13/19, 12:22 AM - Michael Kolber: I get that honestly. Sort of differently, I really want to be friends with Kayla. But after I broke up with her, I guess it was just too much for her. And I respect her for that, even though I wish we could be friends
2/13/19, 12:23 AM - Michael Kolber: Are you scared of how others will treat you because of this?
2/13/19, 12:23 AM - Blah Blah Blah: More her than others
2/13/19, 12:23 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But she did tell 2 ppl in qc
2/13/19, 12:23 AM - Blah Blah Blah: The situation
2/13/19, 12:24 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean i know of 2 could be more
2/13/19, 12:24 AM - Michael Kolber: And are these people treating you differently now?
2/13/19, 12:24 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right i had that with my ex its rlly tough when there r feelings involved
2/13/19, 12:24 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Havent seen them yet
2/13/19, 12:24 AM - Michael Kolber: So you don
(Not trying to be patronizing, just trying to understand)
2/13/19, 12:25 AM - Michael Kolber: *So you don't want to be friends with her, but you're still worried about how she'll react to you telling her that you guys shouldn't be friends anymore?
(Not trying to be patronizing, just trying to understand)
2/13/19, 12:25 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Not just react to that but how she'll be acting when we r around eachotber
2/13/19, 12:25 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah :( And it's tougher for her, too...
2/13/19, 12:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Cuz lately its been awful
2/13/19, 12:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wdym
2/13/19, 12:26 AM - Michael Kolber: I mean it's tougher for Kayla bc I'm the one who ended the relationship, she wanted to keep going
2/13/19, 12:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right exactly
2/13/19, 12:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Ah yeah I see that. But what's at the root of that worry?
Do you not want to have to see her after telling her how you feel? Bc that can be really hard, esp. with someone like Avishag who might make you feel bad about it
2/13/19, 12:28 AM - Michael Kolber: Doesn't mean it's not tough for the person who ends the relationship though
2/13/19, 12:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: If we were in diff colleges i would prob tell het and move on but yeah running into her would be a nightmare
2/13/19, 12:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I know thats the position i played too lol but i still think its tougher on the other side bc they also doubt themselves since they got broken up with
2/13/19, 12:30 AM - Michael Kolber: I had to go through a similar thing in high school, where me and a friend had to break it off. Now I have an ex-close friend and two exes in QC, and it's still not easy seeing them. It's still tough *facing* them after the fighting we went through. But to me it's part of putting my past in my past and remembering that who I am today is still a valid and complete person, even without my old relationships and even having had those fights. It's like I needed to face them to finally accept that I could be a good person even after those relationships ended.
2/13/19, 12:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: What do u mean face them? Like confront? Or is it facing them after it all happened?
2/13/19, 12:32 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Also u have *2* exes here??!?! I hve one and im freaking out woww
2/13/19, 12:32 AM - Michael Kolber: Just being in their presence and making eye contact and being in the same events
2/13/19, 12:32 AM - Michael Kolber: haha yeah.....
The other was supposed to go to another college, buttttttt
2/13/19, 12:33 AM - Michael Kolber: It's really hard, ngl
2/13/19, 12:33 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh :/
2/13/19, 12:33 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah for sure
2/13/19, 12:33 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha plott twissttt
2/13/19, 12:33 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But u and kayla r on good terms no?
2/13/19, 12:35 AM - Michael Kolber: Sorta, but that was after a few months of not talking and super awkward eye contact and dancing around the fact that she has a new boyfriend
2/13/19, 12:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh yeah
2/13/19, 12:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Heard about him
2/13/19, 12:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean after breakups i think the 2 need complete separation if u wanna be friends later on
2/13/19, 12:37 AM - Michael Kolber: So what I'm saying is just bc she'll hate you now doesn't mean it's forever.
And, in my opinion, if you're avoiding breaking off a relationship bc you're scared they'll hate you, then the relationship slowly becomes based on fear instead of based on appreciation of the other person. And I don't think that's a relationship any of us want to be in.
2/13/19, 12:37 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, agreed
2/13/19, 12:38 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wow i rlly meeded to hear this
2/13/19, 12:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Bc theres 1 other relationship (u'd be rlly shocked if u knew who but maybe not lol) that i kinda wanna dim down a bit
2/13/19, 12:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: If that makes sense
2/13/19, 12:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But ive been scared to
2/13/19, 12:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: For a 2nd reason being that i attach to ppl easily and like when someones gone it rlly affects me
2/13/19, 12:40 AM - Michael Kolber: I think I know who ü§ê
2/13/19, 12:40 AM - Michael Kolber: I feel, hardcore I feel.
2/13/19, 12:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Omgomgomgomgomg who
2/13/19, 12:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah
2/13/19, 12:40 AM - Michael Kolber: I'm guessing Shmu
2/13/19, 12:41 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No. Way. For real? I wouldnt think that about u
2/13/19, 12:41 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So frkn accuratw i cant even
2/13/19, 12:41 AM - Michael Kolber: When I attach, then yeah. Sometimes I don't even attach. Gotta work on that, I was rly good at it in the last year of HS, but then in yeshiva and in my first year here I sort of stopped.
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wait wait wait howd u guess
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Michael Kolber: I mean, I for one don't think that the way he treats you is very nice....
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Stopped attaching?
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Michael Kolber: Bc the way he talks to you...idk
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oo i didnt see that coming, why?
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah
2/13/19, 12:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Woww
2/13/19, 12:43 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wait so ur upset tht u stopped attaching?
2/13/19, 12:43 AM - Michael Kolber: I mean, I feel he's sort of demeaning to you sometimes, and it gets to you. And, honestly, if I didn't take every single thing he says with a grain of salt, it would really affect me too
2/13/19, 12:44 AM - Michael Kolber: Not so much that I'm upset, but it makes me unhappy. When I get close to friends it make me happier, and I have some really good friends thank G-d, and I should definitely get closer to them
2/13/19, 12:44 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats so nice:) yeah o hear its nice to have tht feeling but at the same time it hurts sooo much when u or the other person leaves
2/13/19, 12:46 AM - Blah Blah Blah: <Media omitted>
2/13/19, 12:46 AM - Michael Kolber: I agree. But i've learned from experience that the risk of pain is very much worth the happiness from being friends with people. Pain lasts only a short while, but avoiding close friendships because of that means you _always_ have pain, which is way worse. So it's a far better investment in your personal happiness to make close friends :)
2/13/19, 12:46 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah so I cant rlly handle him in person, he like doesnt pay attention to me and when we do tlk we're not nice to each other, and then texting recently is getting weird but idk
2/13/19, 12:47 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah i like that thats very true
2/13/19, 12:47 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its like the saying " Its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"
2/13/19, 12:48 AM - Michael Kolber: I think I understand. I had some really close friends that I thought I'd never stop talking to and then one day I realized "Yeah, I'm not friends with this person like I used to be." And then I didn't really have a reason not to drift. And now we're not best friends anymore, we're just friends, and I'm ok with that because I changed and she changed, and our relationship to each other changed.
2/13/19, 12:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: <Media omitted>
2/13/19, 12:49 AM - Michael Kolber: Exactly. Shakespeare I think
2/13/19, 12:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh is ittt? Thats so cool
2/13/19, 12:49 AM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
2/13/19, 12:49 AM - Michael Kolber: I can see that, yeah
2/13/19, 12:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right yesss the changing part is sooo true bc i think me and her both changed too and things just cant continue like that
2/13/19, 12:50 AM - Michael Kolber: And yeah we def should be sleeping lol
2/13/19, 12:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I made it so much longerüòÖ
2/13/19, 12:50 AM - Michael Kolber: hmm it's like a subconscious sign almost
2/13/19, 12:51 AM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>
2/13/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeahhhh it rlly isss
2/13/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont archive ur chatss
2/13/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah
2/13/19, 12:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: NO WAY what an accomplishment
2/13/19, 12:52 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah. And that's not bad, and sometimes that's the only thing that keeps us back from ending or changing the relationship. That we think back and think "Well we were always best friends. Why should it be any different now?" But there are many reasons why it should be different now
2/13/19, 12:52 AM - Michael Kolber: hahahaha
2/13/19, 12:52 AM - Michael Kolber: not yet üëø

2/13/19, 1:53 AM - Michael Kolber: And for the record I think you should be proud of yourself for standing up to Avishag this far. Just because it's hard now doesn't mean it wasn't hard before, and the fact that you were able to tell her that what she did made you uncomfortable is an accomplishment in itself.
2/13/19, 8:57 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Michael

2/13/19, 10:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah but not the careers
2/13/19, 10:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Theyre from some random post
2/13/19, 10:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right?
2/13/19, 10:42 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah....
2/13/19, 10:42 AM - Michael Kolber: I'm skeptical about the test, idk
2/13/19, 10:43 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well yes ofcourse
2/13/19, 10:43 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its just rlly funny
2/13/19, 10:51 AM - Michael Kolber: I see lol
2/13/19, 10:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But I have to say
2/13/19, 10:51 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Im rlly excited about the idea of going back to the pt place
2/13/19, 10:52 AM - Michael Kolber: Yayy
2/13/19, 10:52 AM - Michael Kolber: ^
2/13/19, 10:52 AM - Michael Kolber: Don't hedge your bets on the one place
2/13/19, 10:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i know i know
2/13/19, 10:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i know its the actual staff and everything tht makes me so happy about the place, i gotta pay attention to the job too
2/13/19, 10:54 AM - Michael Kolber: But if I were you I'd drop the bio course
2/13/19, 10:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Also this
2/13/19, 10:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: whys
2/13/19, 11:00 AM - Michael Kolber: Bc you don't like it and it's harder than it needs to be, no? Unless you possibly need it for PT
2/13/19, 11:07 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i mean yeah it is harder and gross
2/13/19, 11:07 AM - Blah Blah Blah: but if i need it for pt, gotta do what u gotta do
2/13/19, 11:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i just spoke to 2 design majors
2/13/19, 11:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Edens friends just made plans to go out for lunch so now Eden is busyy woohoo
2/13/19, 11:17 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but if you end up NOT doing PT then how far will it set you back to not do bio this semester
2/13/19, 11:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: complicated question
2/13/19, 11:18 AM - Michael Kolber: Eden gas nice friends
2/13/19, 11:18 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah anddddd?
2/13/19, 11:19 AM - Blah Blah Blah: also if i do econ and design i have to do summer classes (3 classes) and 18/21 credits from now on
2/13/19, 11:19 AM - Blah Blah Blah: it was a nice convo, just tlkin about classes, they have some rlly cool ones
2/13/19, 11:25 AM - Michael Kolber: That's insane. No way, especially because if you do that then you're not getting internships in the summer. Bad move imo
2/13/19, 11:25 AM - Blah Blah Blah: right so thats the issue
2/13/19, 11:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i wanna sit down again and right down both schedule options if i do design or pt but theyre both crazy basically
2/13/19, 11:26 AM - Michael Kolber: Why don't you speak to career counseling, they'll tell you if it looks bad to finish in more than 4 years. Because otherwise you're gonna drive yourself nuts
2/13/19, 11:26 AM - Michael Kolber: Ooh yeah
2/13/19, 11:26 AM - Michael Kolber: I see
2/13/19, 11:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: thats a good idea but how do i do that by tomorrow, i think tomorrows the last day to drop
2/13/19, 11:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Also, econ and design? Weird combo
2/13/19, 11:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Just go in today during lunch
2/13/19, 11:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: should i just stick to bio bc either way i need a science
2/13/19, 11:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Or call them on the phone right now
2/13/19, 11:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: im doing so many other things lol but i think thats a good idea
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: i feel like the screams marketing no? hahha
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: No bc having to do 3 weeks of work again in an easier class is not worth doing 11 more weeks of a class you're miserable in
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: ^
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: but i dont think ill get into an easier class at this point
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: Mmmmmm maybe maybe, good call. Or you can do a stats/math major
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: should i walk out of class? yeah im not learning anything anyway
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: But for next semester man
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: Hahaha what class
2/13/19, 11:28 AM - Michael Kolber: Bio?
2/13/19, 11:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: hahah no no
2/13/19, 11:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: bala
2/13/19, 11:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: marketing actually, its interesting but like i can step out
2/13/19, 11:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: thats huge tho
2/13/19, 11:42 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but 18/21 credits a semester is insane
2/13/19, 11:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: but its design
2/13/19, 11:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: and eden doesnt have a choie
2/13/19, 11:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: choice
2/13/19, 11:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: is there a way i can maybe combine 2 majors and create a new one? ive heard of ppl doing tht
2/13/19, 12:13 PM - Michael Kolber: Hmm not sure
2/13/19, 12:13 PM - Michael Kolber: Yes, take more than 4 years lol
2/13/19, 12:13 PM - Michael Kolber: Ask career counseling!!!!

2/14/19, 12:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: credits i got from hs
2/14/19, 12:34 AM - Michael Kolber: Oh cool
2/14/19, 12:34 AM - Michael Kolber: You got all those APs? Nice
2/14/19, 12:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: haah thx
2/14/19, 12:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: math wasnt an AP it was thru touro but ye
2/14/19, 12:46 AM - Michael Kolber: This one needs the two more courses to the right also, no? And I think it's a super bad idea because instead of getting work experience in the summer, you're stuck taking classes. And work experience is super important! People who take internships during college get better jobs than those who don't. Plus you need a break from the stress of school
2/14/19, 12:47 AM - Michael Kolber: Some stupid science lol
2/14/19, 12:47 AM - Michael Kolber: This one is called "impossible"

2/14/19, 1:24 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I feel like we're all going at the same time and gonna take up the whole theater lol
2/14/19, 1:26 PM - Michael Kolber: Galentine's day is weird
2/14/19, 1:26 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha why
2/14/19, 1:28 PM - Michael Kolber: Because it just seems sorta like women reinforcing the idea that you need a man
2/14/19, 1:28 PM - Michael Kolber: "If I have a man I'll go on a Valentine's date. If not I'm gonna make a point to go with my other single girls"
2/14/19, 1:29 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahahahh i hear
2/14/19, 1:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Theres a certain movie coming out today too so i guess that strengthens ur idea
2/14/19, 1:31 PM - Michael Kolber: A movie comes out every year on Valentine's
2/14/19, 1:31 PM - Michael Kolber: I can assure you Rebel Wilson is not singlehandedly leading galentines
2/14/19, 1:35 PM - Michael Kolber: <Media omitted>

2/14/19, 4:20 PM - Michael Kolber: hahaha
2/14/19, 4:22 PM - Michael Kolber: clean doesn't necessarily mean sparse. it can, but it really implies that it's not visually cluttered. There's a lot there but I don't think you get lost in it, everything has it's place, it's organized in a manner where everything is grouped into information types (date, contact info, names), and each of them takes up the full width so it's one set of info per row
2/14/19, 4:28 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Michael u cant send me such long messages
2/14/19, 4:28 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Nonexistent attention span

2/17/19, 12:38 AM - Michael Kolber: ok, your call
2/17/19, 12:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Felt bad for u lol
2/17/19, 12:39 AM - Michael Kolber: kind of you but I rly don't mind talking about it
2/17/19, 12:45 AM - Blah Blah Blah: She just brought up something from wed again
2/17/19, 12:46 AM - Michael Kolber: This sounds like a pattern with her
2/17/19, 12:46 AM - Michael Kolber: bringing up old things
2/17/19, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah
2/17/19, 12:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And pushing it off for later
2/17/19, 12:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah....
2/17/19, 12:55 AM - Michael Kolber: not very nice of her
2/17/19, 12:56 AM - Michael Kolber: Like as someone who's really slow at processing things I get it, but there's a time limit on stuff you know?
2/17/19, 12:58 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah for sure
2/17/19, 12:58 AM - Blah Blah Blah: A part of me feels like she has nothing else on me so she keeps revisiting these
2/17/19, 12:59 AM - Michael Kolber: I feel like the underlying implication of that message is "She's out to get me", which idk if you actually feel that or not
2/17/19, 1:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha no no not shes out to get me
2/17/19, 1:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But somehow SOME HOW i keep apoligizing
2/17/19, 1:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And i dnt even know why
2/17/19, 1:05 AM - Michael Kolber: Do you feel responsible?
2/17/19, 1:11 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont think so
2/17/19, 1:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ill tell u what it is, shes mentioned all these things from the past like either a year ago or the summer and that kinda led me to believe that maybe the way shes been acting was bc of those one or two things
2/17/19, 1:14 AM - Michael Kolber: And you think she's been holding a grudge for a year? or did she just remember it now bc of something that came up?
2/17/19, 1:15 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont think its a grudge
2/17/19, 1:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But it kinda can be bc shes brought it up like a tinyy bit before
2/17/19, 1:16 AM - Michael Kolber: I see
2/17/19, 1:17 AM - Michael Kolber: Question, do you want to go through the process of saying sorry and making up? Or do you want her to leave you alone?
2/17/19, 1:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I wanna be casual friends
2/17/19, 1:19 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Does that mean anything to u? Lol
2/17/19, 1:19 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but like
2/17/19, 1:19 AM - Michael Kolber: You don't get to choose that
2/17/19, 1:19 AM - Michael Kolber: She chooses that
2/17/19, 1:19 AM - Michael Kolber: If you change the relationship, you don't get to choose by how much
2/17/19, 1:20 AM - Michael Kolber: Because if you restrict it to a certain degree, she can restrict it to any further degree she wants. And the same would be true if the situation was flipped. If someone tells you they only want to be casual friends, you can say "hell no" and cut them out completely.
2/17/19, 1:20 AM - Michael Kolber: Unfortunately you don't really have the freedom of choosing a middle ground
2/17/19, 1:21 AM - Michael Kolber: And I don't think you can make her want to choose a middle ground either, I think it's just gonna be what she feels
2/17/19, 1:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So basically
2/17/19, 1:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its all on her lol?
2/17/19, 1:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Also i dont wanna tell her that
2/17/19, 1:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats what im trying to avoid
2/17/19, 1:33 AM - Michael Kolber: not exactly....
If you decide you want to keep on being friends with her then chances are your relationship will stay the same. And then you can work on your friendship with her.
But if you decide you want to be just casual friends, then she'll either agree or back out completely. It's all on her once you decide that, but until then it's pretty much evenly in both your courts
2/17/19, 1:34 AM - Michael Kolber: You don't have to. I think it's generally understood.
2/17/19, 1:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right true. I would rather be completely done but we do see each other and are involved the same groups so theres that plus we were in the same grade so whenever there r events we'll run into each other and whatever
2/17/19, 1:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But i also dont want to be as close as we were before and even now its like a little odd but she tells me things as if everything is okay
2/17/19, 1:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No cuz wed night she ended by saying we need to tlk in person and same with tonight
2/17/19, 1:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But when we tlk in person it never goes anywhere
2/17/19, 1:37 AM - Michael Kolber: Maybe because one of you (or both of you) is avoiding actually saying that you don't want to be friends anymore...
2/17/19, 1:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But the other day she went on and on about how shd rlly wants to be good friends even tho there is this 1 thing blocking her from completely "trusting" me I guess
2/17/19, 1:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Idk which word to use there
2/17/19, 1:40 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, but you don't want to be good friends. And I get the feeling that she doesn't understand that
2/17/19, 1:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah she doesnt
2/17/19, 1:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Cuz ive never said it
2/17/19, 1:40 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Or hinted even
2/17/19, 1:40 AM - Michael Kolber: I hear but that doesn't mean you'll be friends at all. I know people at QC who I have a history with, I see them all the times and have events with them but we barely speak
2/17/19, 1:41 AM - Blah Blah Blah: No it doesnt mean we'll be friends but I dnt want those awkward uncomfortable moments
2/17/19, 1:41 AM - Michael Kolber: Right. So it makes sense to me that she would keep treating you like a close friend. Bc from her perspective, you guys just had a rough patch and now she's trying to make it better
2/17/19, 1:41 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Do u have those now with those ppl
2/17/19, 1:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ah, yeah i see
2/17/19, 1:43 AM - Michael Kolber: A little, yeah. It's worn off over the years...
But if you don't want to have awkward moments then it means you'll have to pretend that you still want to be friends. Idk if that will make you feel better or worse...
2/17/19, 1:43 AM - Michael Kolber: Plus, she'll probably realize eventually. And then what's gonna happen?
2/17/19, 1:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well im not good at it
2/17/19, 1:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Also YEARSSS thats crazy
2/17/19, 1:49 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I cant do that
2/17/19, 1:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Bc with her its not just awkward moments its also like snobby ones
2/17/19, 1:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean I think she can already tell that Im not fully there bc shes not getting the usual reactions plus im not good at faking
2/17/19, 1:50 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I think thats why she keeps txting me and bringing up different thinhs
2/17/19, 1:51 AM - Michael Kolber: What's stopping you from just telling her?
2/17/19, 1:51 AM - Michael Kolber: Is it the confrontation?
2/17/19, 1:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yes
2/17/19, 1:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And she'll be upset
2/17/19, 1:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And hurt
2/17/19, 1:54 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And then it goes back to how we were a week ago
2/17/19, 1:55 AM - Michael Kolber: She's gonna be upset and hurt anyway if you pretend to be her friend, it's just that she'll be upset and hurt later rather than now
2/17/19, 1:55 AM - Michael Kolber: Except you guys probably won't be talking, and she'll probably avoid you (or you her)
2/17/19, 1:55 AM - Blah Blah Blah: We werent tlking a week ago and she was avoiding me
2/17/19, 1:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: That was one of the things she said in the car the other day, that shes been avoiding me so she couldnt be around her friends all tht mucj
2/17/19, 1:56 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Much
2/17/19, 1:56 AM - Michael Kolber: And why does that bother you if you want to be totally done with her?
2/17/19, 1:57 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Cuz when I do see her itll suck, like before we tlked when she was avoiding me i couldve had the best day and then a 5 minutes encounter with her and i felt awful for the night
2/17/19, 1:59 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, you're right, it will suck. But you know what? It'll suck a lot for a few weeks, and then it'll stop sucking.
If you don't face her, it'll suck a little bit but for a _long_ time. And my bet is that the little bit of annoyance will wear you down a lot over time.
2/17/19, 2:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Okay u have a point
2/17/19, 2:00 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I think I just need to word it a certain way though
2/17/19, 2:01 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Also Idk how Im doing this in person ah
2/17/19, 2:01 AM - Michael Kolber: My advice? Write a script and stick to it.
2/17/19, 2:04 AM - Michael Kolber: - What you're doing (no longer being friends)
- Why you're doing it (because you don't want a friend who makes you feel bad about yourself, even after you've tried many times to reconcile with her)
- Final words

You don't need to get into arguments, and you don't have to rationalize it any more than explaining why, maybe an example of when she hurt you. You don't _owe_ her a long convo about this, and she doesn't owe you anything either
2/17/19, 2:04 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Dang it, I knew I shouldve taken drama for my creative expression
2/17/19, 2:04 AM - Michael Kolber: hahaha
2/17/19, 2:04 AM - Michael Kolber: Not a word-for-word script. Just an outline with the pertinent info
2/17/19, 2:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh this is nottt going to be fun
2/17/19, 2:05 AM - Michael Kolber: This doesn't have to be a dramatic affair with her accusing you and you defending yourself. She'll probably try to make it that. *Don't* let her.
2/17/19, 2:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right right I need to get all my ideas down so I cover everything I need to be that never seems to happen
2/17/19, 2:05 AM - Michael Kolber: All it has to be is a message, a reason, and final words.
2/17/19, 2:05 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Howwwww then itll become a whole convo
2/17/19, 2:06 AM - Michael Kolber: That's what I'm saying, *don't* try to cover everything. Because if you do then you're gonna argue over every small point. Keep it large-scale
2/17/19, 2:06 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohhhh
2/17/19, 2:06 AM - Michael Kolber: ^
2/17/19, 2:06 AM - Blah Blah Blah: A reason with an example tho
2/17/19, 2:06 AM - Michael Kolber: only if she asks for it
2/17/19, 2:07 AM - Michael Kolber: and if she tries to give an excuse, don't get goaded into an argument. just tell her "fine, but you still made me feel bad about myself, more than once, and friends don't do that."
2/17/19, 2:07 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Not even 1 example regardless? I feel like knowing her she wont ask for examples
2/17/19, 2:08 AM - Michael Kolber: Like the old quote goes, "It's not personal, but it's personal." It's not that you don't like _her_, it's that you can't be friends with someone who acts the way she does, for your own happiness/mental health
2/17/19, 2:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wow idk why but this text just made me realize that if we dont even discuss this, like if i just say fine and whatever its really the end
2/17/19, 2:08 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I agree 1000%
2/17/19, 2:09 AM - Michael Kolber: no, bc then you're narrowing it down to one occurence, and she'll make excuses for it and to her it'll feel like it all centers around that occurrence.
2/17/19, 2:10 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah true I feel like thats happened before
2/17/19, 2:10 AM - Michael Kolber: Think about how you thought when she brought up the incidents from a year ago. You started thinking "What if this is all about that incident?" It's probably not, but that's how we think. We zero in on things. If you give her something to zero in on, she will zero in on it. If you keep it broad, she'll also keep it broad. If she asks for an example, tell her there are many, There's the time she did x, the time she did y, the time she did z. Don't dwell on any of them
2/17/19, 2:11 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah... you have just as much power here as she does, the key is realizing it
2/17/19, 2:12 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ahh I see
2/17/19, 2:12 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So I probably shouldnt even worry about the few things she mentioned
2/17/19, 2:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: And also not to go into anything bc I knooww itll become a conversation
2/17/19, 2:13 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But u know what they say... with great power comes a great electiric bill... I dont think I van afford that
2/17/19, 2:13 AM - Michael Kolber: Not that you shouldn't worry about them, just like she shouldn't *not* worry about the instances that you bring up. But I'm saying those aren't the cause of the tension between you guys
2/17/19, 2:14 AM - Michael Kolber: yeah, that's what I would recommend
2/17/19, 2:14 AM - Michael Kolber: Hahahahaha, I've never heard anyone say that. But yes, you can afford it.
2/17/19, 2:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh for sure
2/17/19, 2:14 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But thats the thing!!!
2/17/19, 2:15 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I was willing to give it all another shot, not likes best friends but like good friends bc I started doubting where all the tension came from in the first place
2/17/19, 2:15 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Whatttt?! Its soo a thing, I need to enlighten u
2/17/19, 2:16 AM - Michael Kolber: You can _enlighten_ me with your _power_
2/17/19, 2:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: <Media omitted>
2/17/19, 2:16 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I cant use my power for evilüôàüôà
2/17/19, 2:17 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeahhhhh but you never broke it off in the first place. So to you it's another shot but to her it's reducing the friendship to a shadow of what it once was. You didn't tell her how you felt, you can't just now tell her that you retroactively stopped being friends with her
2/17/19, 2:17 AM - Michael Kolber: none of these are grammatically correct
2/17/19, 2:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: The bill was too large, the memers lost focus
2/17/19, 2:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Oh true she doesnt know about that whole part
2/17/19, 2:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: BUT
2/17/19, 2:18 AM - Blah Blah Blah: In the car she said something like "Now that we're friends again...." üôÑ
2/17/19, 2:19 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah but I don't think that's what she meant....
2/17/19, 2:19 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Also michael, on a very serious note, have u noticed have androids whatsapp emojis have changed? Im disgusted
2/17/19, 2:19 AM - Michael Kolber: I think we both know that there would have been a MUCH bigger backlash if she thought you guys actually weren't friends anymore
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: üòÇ
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Michael Kolber: Hm good call
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ur not wrong
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Michael Kolber: Actually no bad call they look the same
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Nuh uh
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Update ur whatsapp
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Michael Kolber: Update your face
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ill wear a paperbag on tuesday
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Any other suggestions?
2/17/19, 2:20 AM - Michael Kolber: Haha
2/17/19, 2:21 AM - Michael Kolber: It's up to date
2/17/19, 2:21 AM - Blah Blah Blah: They lie
2/17/19, 2:21 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah go tell Avishag how you feel so that you can finally feel better about yourself
2/17/19, 2:21 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahaha
2/17/19, 2:21 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its so true its sad lol
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Michael Kolber: üò•
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wait
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Michael Kolber: Waiting
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Small issue
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I dont want either of us to look like the bad guy and now some ppl from her side know and its just kahdiwixbskx
2/17/19, 2:22 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Like mutual friends
2/17/19, 2:23 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah
2/17/19, 2:23 AM - Michael Kolber: That's not in either of your controls
2/17/19, 2:23 AM - Michael Kolber: People will think what they want to regardless
2/17/19, 2:23 AM - Michael Kolber: Not to mention that you'll definitely seem like the bad guy if you slowly "drift", as you put it
2/17/19, 2:23 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right
2/17/19, 2:24 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I guess in this case she'll be the victim that I hurt
2/17/19, 2:24 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Fun
2/17/19, 2:25 AM - Michael Kolber: People fall out all the time, I wouldn't worry too much about what other people think. Part of why I was scared to break up with Kayla was because we had so many mutual friends. At the end of the day, they were all supportive of both of us, because they were both of our friends, and they were good friends which meant that they didn't let other people's relationships have an effect on their friendships
2/17/19, 2:26 AM - Michael Kolber: Same way I'm friends with Naomi even though she's friends with Shaanan
2/17/19, 2:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I love that
2/17/19, 2:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Really is a test of friendship
2/17/19, 2:26 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah ive thought about that before lol
2/17/19, 2:27 AM - Michael Kolber: dating** not friends lol
2/17/19, 2:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah that hahah
2/17/19, 2:27 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, and everyone passed with flying colors :)
2/17/19, 2:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha nice! Thats so great
2/17/19, 2:27 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U have such great friends
2/17/19, 2:28 AM - Michael Kolber: I'm sure you do too!
2/17/19, 2:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha yeah I do
2/17/19, 2:28 AM - Michael Kolber: It really boils down to drama
2/17/19, 2:28 AM - Michael Kolber: My friends don't do drama
2/17/19, 2:28 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yesss
2/17/19, 2:29 AM - Michael Kolber: So that makes things easier
2/17/19, 2:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I have friends who dont, its the best
2/17/19, 2:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its soo unnecessary
2/17/19, 2:29 AM - Michael Kolber: yeahhhhhh
2/17/19, 2:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Haha 6 h's
2/17/19, 2:29 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hes in agreement
2/17/19, 2:30 AM - Michael Kolber: These people are all dramatics. That's part of why we're not friends anymore. They're in college and _still_ have and make drama
2/17/19, 2:31 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohh I see then u for sure made the right decision, thats another reason I distanced myself from her in the first place, couldnt handle the drama
2/17/19, 2:33 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Its so weird knowing this now cuz Ive looked around at ppl and thought wow theyve probably never had beef or drama with anyone bc theres so incredibly kind or whatever and now that I think about it we have nooooo clue what anyones been through with anyone else
2/17/19, 2:33 AM - Michael Kolber: Yeah, very true
2/17/19, 2:33 AM - Michael Kolber: And also beef =/= drama
2/17/19, 2:33 AM - Michael Kolber: I have beef with some people, doesn't mean I go around making it everyone else's problem
2/17/19, 2:34 AM - Michael Kolber: And similarly, if other people have a problem with each other, it doesn't mean I have a problem with either of them
2/17/19, 2:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Well yes u cant eat drama
2/17/19, 2:34 AM - Michael Kolber: fight me
2/17/19, 2:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Right, which is very important too
2/17/19, 2:34 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahaha i feel like u used to say that alot
2/17/19, 2:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah i know bc I never knew! Lol
2/17/19, 2:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: This is fascinating
2/17/19, 2:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean i knew u had an issue with shaanon but thats about it
2/17/19, 2:35 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Wouldnt it be faster to say doesn't equal than finding all these symbols
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Michael Kolber: it's a great line to use when people tell you you can't do something that's obviously impossible lo
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Michael Kolber: l
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahaha
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Michael Kolber: 3 keystrokes vs 13. so, no.
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Michael Kolber: also fight me
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I like it, im stealing it
2/17/19, 2:36 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But its sooo latee go awaayy
2/17/19, 2:37 AM - Michael Kolber: no u
2/17/19, 2:37 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Mikis 2nd fav line

2/17/19, 2:38 AM - Blah Blah Blah: But whyyyy
2/17/19, 2:38 AM - Blah Blah Blah: U told me once u didnt like that i called u michael, actually i think u told avishag and i was there or something
2/17/19, 2:38 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Hahah well yes that would make sense
2/17/19, 2:39 AM - Michael Kolber: I don't really care if you call me michael or meecha-el or anything like that. I just don't like "mickey"
2/17/19, 2:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Do u not like that anyone calls u mickey?
2/17/19, 2:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Can i change ur name in my phone to meecha-el
2/17/19, 2:39 AM - Blah Blah Blah: üòÇ
2/17/19, 2:41 AM - Michael Kolber: unless it's my family, no, not really. I'm not gonna correct an old friend if they call me that bc that's what they're used to and it's weird for them. but anyone who's met me recently I'd rather not
2/17/19, 2:41 AM - Michael Kolber: yeah almond gal go for it
2/17/19, 2:41 AM - Blah Blah Blah: Ohhh i see makes sense michael
2/17/19, 2:41 AM - Blah Blah Blah: I thought u changed itt
2/17/19, 2:42 AM - Blah Blah Blah: So sad that the r u nuts chat isnt a thing

3/16/19, 9:26 PM - Michael Kolber: And you're not even gonna try to get a ride?
3/16/19, 9:26 PM - Michael Kolber: Or ask me if I can get one for you?

3/16/19, 9:27 PM - Michael Kolber: Like always?
3/16/19, 9:27 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Hey this was suuper spontaneous
3/16/19, 9:30 PM - Michael Kolber: Yes, but even when it's not spontaneous
3/16/19, 9:30 PM - Michael Kolber: It just seems like you always have excuses
3/16/19, 9:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Thats not true
3/16/19, 9:30 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Most of them have been valid
3/16/19, 9:31 PM - Michael Kolber: You're right, but they're still excuses
3/16/19, 9:32 PM - Michael Kolber: If you're not up to it tonight then I get it, but not having a ride is definitely not a reason not to come. I know 2 people coming who have cars and could pick you up. I totally understand if you just want tonight to yourself after a long shabbos but if you give excuses then it just seems like you don't actually want to come
3/16/19, 9:34 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I mean Im rlly not up for it tonight, canceled on my other friends cuz I want a chill night
3/16/19, 9:34 PM - Blah Blah Blah: You know Im always down for movie nights
3/16/19, 9:42 PM - Michael Kolber: Ok so that's fine, but then just tell me :)
Otherwise it seems like you're just saying that you want to come but you don't actually, and that's kind of hurtful
3/16/19, 9:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: No no thats not the case at all
3/16/19, 9:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: But I see what ur saying
3/16/19, 9:43 PM - Blah Blah Blah: I got rlly excited when I saw the chat lol
3/16/19, 9:44 PM - Michael Kolber: Ok good :)
3/16/19, 9:45 PM - Michael Kolber: Yeah I thought so but just from what you said it made it seem like it could be otherwise
3/16/19, 9:48 PM - Blah Blah Blah: Yeah I realized that I worded it reaaalllly badlyüôàüôà im sorry
3/16/19, 9:54 PM - Michael Kolber: It's ok :)
